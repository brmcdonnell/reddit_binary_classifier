# Reddit Post Binary Classifier

<i>Pulling information and classifying posts via Reddit's API</i>

**Author: Brendan McDonnell**

## Problem Statement:

I used the pushshift API to collect posts from two subreddits, `r/The_Donald` and `r/Republican`. Using natural language processing (NLP), I trained a binary classification model to predict which subreddit a given post came from.

**Reddit pages chosen**
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/

**From r/Republican Community Details**

>/r/Republican is a partisan subreddit. This is a place for Republicans to discuss issues with other Republicans.<

**From r/The_Donald Community Details**

>The_Donald is a never-ending rally dedicated to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.<

These two subreddits bear some similarities and should have some overlap. However, it's important to note that r/The_Donald has been quarantined recently for attempting to incite violence against police and other public officials, a violation of the reddit's content policy. It is a well known and used alt-right subreddit. By contrast, r/Republican is a subreddit that should reflect contemporary Republican views. There will likely be some NSFW material on r/The_Donald, but I believe a model like this could be very useful for understanding the difference in viewpoint between traditional republicans and the recent alt-right movement.

## Results:

Both a Gaussian Naive Bayes model and a Logistic Regression model were fit. The Logistic Regression model ended up being the best of the two, and it used Ridge Regression on term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TFIDF) vectorized titles from the reddit data. The Logistic Regression was able to classify titles accurately ~75% of the time.

## Recommendations for Future Changes:

1. I would really like to fit a Random Forest model to this data and see if the weaker classification accuracy was a modeling error.
2. If other models don't seem to classify significantly better than a logistic regression, it would be smart to look at two subreddits that are a bit more dissimilar as there is a lot of overlap in material between these two.
