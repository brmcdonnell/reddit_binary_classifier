The Dems first debate is tonight and wow, what a total shit show in store for us tonight. They could not have selected a worse crop to kick off night one. Headlining the evening we have Pocahontas (aka Mrs. Stalin), Beto the-Irishman-who-thinks-he’s-a-Mexican O’Rourke, SPARTACUS, and a bunch of no names who can’t even crack 1%. 

Now, we all know there are going to be things said, things that will trigger a deeply primal reaction within our brains to chug the nearest alcohol. BUT some rules may make the experience a little better. What I propose...

RUSSIA (any mention of collusion or obstruction of justice must be met with a 5 second chug or a shot).  

Green New Deal (Another 5 second Chug/ shot or just drink until it makes sense).

TRUMP (Any mention of our God Emperor must be met with a 3 sec. chug). 

REPARATIONS ( 3 sec.)

FREE COLLEGE/HEALTHCARE (3 sec.) 

ABORTION (any mention of it should be met with 3 sec. chug. In the case of FULL TERM ABORTION 5 sec.)

The general premise is that the crazier the idea the more you drink. Good luck tonight. Many of us may not survive with such rules but it’s the only way we’ll make it through the 2 hours.

If a state currently has a Republican U.S. Senator, I did not include them in this list, no matter how ""blue"" that state may be. (i.e. - Maine, Sen. Susan Collins)

It's hard to believe that, as recently as the first three days of 2009, states like Oregon, New Mexico, Minnesota, and Virginia had Republican senators. Then again, it's amazing that Vermont, Maryland, and Massachusetts currently have Republican governors, all of whom have high approval ratings.

I too worked in college while my peers had free time, just so that I wouldn’t graduate with tons of loans.

Even whites who identify as black. They are black. 

Children matter. 
Even adults who identify as children. They are children.

Disabled matter.
Even the abled who identify as disabled. They are disabled.

Women matter.
Even men who identify as women. They are women. 

What you were born does not matter. What you believe you are matters.

Whites who identify as black are more oppressed than blacks. Their bodies do not reflect their identity. They have had to struggle to be recognized as something they are not. They deserve to define what it means to be black.

Adults who identify as children are more oppressed than children. Their bodies do not reflect their identity. They have had to struggle to be recognized as something they are not. They deserve to define what it means to be a child.

Abled who identify as disabled are more oppressed than disabled. Their bodies do not reflect their identity. They have had to struggle to be recognized as something they are not. They deserve to define what it means to be disabled.

Men who identify as women are more oppressed than females. Their bodies do not reflect their identity. They have had to struggle to be recognized as something they are not. They deserve to define womanhood.

There is no difference between a white-black and a racial-black.
There is no difference between an adult-child and a chronological child.
There is no difference between an abled-disabled and the physically or mentally impaired.
There is no difference between a trans-woman and a biological female.

Blacks are racist if they tell whites who identifies as black that they are not black.
Children are ageist if they tell adults who identify as children that they are not children.
Disabled are ablest if they tell abled who identify as disabled that they are not disabled.
Women are misogynist if they tell men who identify as women that they are not women.

So I cannot be the only one who gets tired of the politics Netflix tries to push on us.

Just watch The Society, newest show on Netflix. This group of about 100 teenagers gets isolated in a town with no adults, no internet connection etc.

The sisters, main characters (Cassandra and Allie) are the goodie goodie. After the boys randalized the town for supplies, they will heroically group all the woman of the town, and explain how ""testosterone"" is going to ruin everything.

The good sensible grown up guy is Will Leclair, a mixed race who rocks dreadlocks or something. Of course all the other trashy frat guys are white, as white as can be. Even the sweet boy who loves Cassandra is latino. And the only white guy who isn't trash is deaf, so of course he cannot be an asshole.

I guess I just wish I could be heard from these politicians at Netflix, and explain to them, that alienating whites and man, isn't going to fix anything. I don't even think they try to fix ""racism"" or ""sexism"" really. Maybe they think they do, but that s not what they are doing. Not by pushing this black or white mentality",Maxinprogress

I haven’t posted in some time and normally just lurk, but I am genuinely at a road block when trying to figure out options when it comes to affordable schooling. I am for a free market and letting the market decide what the cost of a good or service should be considering supply and demand along with competition, but I can’t seem to grasp why no (democratic) candidate who is pushing for further government tuition assistance seems to be speaking on public universities’ inflating tuition costs at a much higher rate than government aid coming in with inflation included.

If more tuition assistance comes in, wouldn’t that just make the dollar more obsolete in the university system thus raising the cost of tuition even more, or am I missing something? I genuinely would like an explanation as to if I have the wrong train of thought, or why this isn’t being discussed in politics on the left. 

Here is the source I read through that made me question this (particularly calculating government aid from the final chart which shows government aid prior to the recession vs. 2016-2017 leading a difference of only $2990 of government aid over a 4 year span):

[**Seattle’s Revolt of the Elites**](https://www.city-journal.org/seattleforall-campaign)

Since the release of Eric Johnson’s documentary [Seattle Is Dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpAi70WWBlw),  which depicts an epidemic of street homelessness, addiction, crime, and disorder, city elites have launched a coordinated information campaign targeted at voters frustrated with the city’s response to homelessness.  Earlier this month, leaked documents revealed that a group of prominent  nonprofits—the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Campion Advocacy  Fund, the Raikes Foundation, and the Ballmer Group—hired a PR firm,  Pyramid Communications, to conduct polling, create messaging, and disseminate the resulting content through a network of silent partners  in academia, the press, government, and the nonprofit sector. The  campaign, #SeattleForAll, **is a case study in what writer James Lindsay calls “idea laundering”—creating misinformation and legitimizing it as  objective truth through repetition in sympathetic media.**

The key messages of the campaign include a number of misleading claims, including: 

\-“Seattle is making progress to end homelessness,” 

\-“1  in 4 people experiencing homelessness in our community struggle with  drug or alcohol abuse,” and 

\-“\[62 percent of Seattle voters believe\] we  are not spending enough to address homelessness.” 

All three contentions fail to meet basic scrutiny: street homelessness has increased 131 percent over the past five years; King County’s lawsuit against Purdue Pharma admits that “the majority of the homeless population is addicted  to or uses opioids” (not one in four); and 62 percent of Seattle voters agree to the statement “we are not spending enough” only when it is directly prefaced in the polling questionnaire by the phrase “other cities of the same size are spending 2 to 3 times the amount that  Seattle is and are seeing significant reductions in homelessness”—itself  an unsubstantiated claim. (When the same question is presented  neutrally, without the framing, support for “we are not spending enough” drops to 7 percent).

The inner workings of the #SeattleForAll campaign tell a clear story:  a group of well-funded philanthropies hired a PR firm to produce misleading polling results, distributed them through the city’s main newspaper and other media outlets (many of which enjoy generous donations from those same philanthropies), and then concealed the fact that the messaging was part of a broader campaign coordinated with the city. The “counter-narrative” to the Seattle Is Dying documentary was not a spontaneous reaction of a diverse group of experts; it was a  planned effort by Seattle’s philanthropic, academic, media, and  governmental elites to steamroll critics. Seattle’s institutional  powers, in other words, attempted to quash the emerging public consensus  that the city’s approach to homelessness is failing.

A quarter-century ago, social critic Christopher Lasch observed the  beginnings of this kind of phenomenon, arguing that **America’s political and cultural elites were starting to revolt against the people.** While during Lasch’s time this elite contempt was directed against “middle  America”—an early iteration of today’s “deplorables”—coastal  progressivism has now reached the point that the new elites have gone  into revolt against themselves. In Seattle, the emerging activist  class—billionaire philanthropists, multimillionaire politicians, and  likeminded commentators in academia and prestige media—has begun an  information offensive against the liberal, wealthy, educated residents  of a city that gave Hillary Clinton 92 percent of its votes. Scolding the public to be more “compassionate,” this new hyper-elite has shown  only contempt for middle-class residents in Seattle’s hardest-hit  neighborhoods…

3146,"The Left has been lying to the American people for decades & the MSM has followed with lies supporting the undermining of our country. In a meeting of the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller bragged about how the media had kept quiet about the intentions of the Commission to the American people",5,bg3m1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/bg3m1c/the_left_has_been_lying_to_the_american_people/,1,2019-04-22 18:45:56,"In a 1991 meeting of the Trilateral Commission Rockefeller said this:  

**“We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time  Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our  meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty  years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the  world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during  those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared  to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an  intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the  national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.”**

The media’s silence on this is treasonous at best. David Rockefeller was even proud of the fact that he and his family were traitors. On page 405 of his autobiography Memoirs he states this: 

**“Some even believe we  are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the  United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists and  of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated  global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If  that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”** 

\-----Again, media  has remained silent about these acts of treason because they are right  in the middle of it…

The editorial board of the Boston Herald published a piece on Monday titled [“Democrats and toxic media at their worst,”](https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/04/08/democrats-and-toxic-media-at-their-worst/) revealing how top names in the news business intentionally twist the president’s words to mislead and divide the public.

**“The left and its compliant media are willfully reporting false news to the American people,”** the Herald’s editors said.

**“Whether it is a symptom of mass hysteria that is the genesis for  this confirmation bias-style reporting or an intentional maneuver to  spread anti-Trump propaganda, its effect is toxic and pernicious.”** 

There was a time when what was reported in the newspaper was proper  information, relevant to what was needed to maintain a civilized society but that hasn’t been the case for over a hundred and fifty years. It  has become a publication for indoctrination into the leftist agenda.  Virtually all media has gone down that road.

## Immigration judges cannot release migrants who are caught sneaking  into the United States, even if the migrants ask for asylum, says a  binding legal decision by Attorney General William Barr.

The decision will dramatically shift the migration-caused civic and  housing crises from the nation’s blue-collar communities over to the  Congress and the Department of Homeland Security, whose budget and  detention centers only have enough resources to house about 50,000  people year-round.

“The \[text of the relevant\] Act provides that, if an alien in  expedited proceedings establishes a credible fear, he “shall be detained  for further consideration of the application for asylum,” says Barr’s  April 16 [decision](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/1154747/download), titled. *Matter of M-S-*.  Because of the law, “I order that, unless DHS paroles the respondent  under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act, he must be detained until his  removal proceedings conclude.”

“This is a HUGE ruling that will harm thousands seeking protection  from persecution at the US border since far more will be held in  detention even after passing the threshold screening under the credible  fear standard,” complained Greg Chen, director of government relations  at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The association’s lawyers make their money by guiding migrants and  corporate hiring managers through the extremely dense network of  migration laws and regulations. But Barr’s decision blocks the use of a  common path for migrants who are trying to get through the courts and  into the U.S. jobs they need to repay the smuggling fees they owe to the  cartels.",SuperCharged2000

It’s completely absurd of them to ask for you to impeach Trump, yet they can’t even back their claims.

Edit: Wow, I am baffled, I was just talking to my little brother and asked him what he thought about Trump, and he said he wanted him impeached, when I asked him why he quoted this ad word for word like it was his own opinion. I called him out on it and he couldn’t give me a reason why he doesn’t like Trump. Just like these ads can’t

It seems to me that every year of my high school career my English teacher has been unashamed in promoting their political views in the class. Having one sided “discussions” about “common sense gun control,” constantly pointing to the right side of the political spectrum as an evil force that is against women and minorities, and literally saying that the left wing is the way forward. I would be fine with having political discussions and analysis in English if both sides were presented in a fair and fact/historical basis. But it is absolutely one sided and this irks me so much because all the students who never do their research on issues blindly believe whatever sensationalized crap they see on social media and then have it confirmed in English class.

The video creator claims to have picked up a pamphlet at some climate change event and at about the 5 minute mark he shows a page from said pamphlet.  Right there in big bold words it says ""Join US in Fighting for a Green New Deal!"" This pamphlet is from 2014! So I started searching around and its a real thing. 

On Page 4: [http://redandgreen.org/Climate\_Change/CCDS\_Climate\_Change\_Pamphlet\_C3\_address.pdf](http://redandgreen.org/Climate_Change/CCDS_Climate_Change_Pamphlet_C3_address.pdf)

&#x200B;

So I looked into the organization behind the pamphlet and they are out to end our current form of government and they don't even bother hiding it.

#### CRISIS: THE CAUSE IS CAPITALISM

**“Free Market” Collapse**

The collapse of the financial sector and the bailouts of insolvent banks have provoked unprecedented public outrage. The transfer of trillions of taxpayer funds into the pockets of corrupt Wall Street speculators, while millions of working people face home foreclosure and loss of employment, has triggered demands for “bailouts of working people, not bailouts of banks.”

The Reagan, Clinton, and Bush administrations had systematically gutted the regulation of banking and investment practices. Regulations established to save capitalism from its own worst abuses were jettisoned in the name of the “free market.” The unprecedented power of finance capital, accumulated since the Reagan era, enabled the arrogance, greed, and criminal behavior on Wall Street, and in turn, its control of the political class and regulatory agencies.

The collapse of the financial sector has led to widespread questioning of capitalism, especially among young people who increasingly see the root cause of the economic crisis as the capitalist system itself.

**Political Economy of Capitalism**

Human labor creates the value from which profit is derived. Surplus value is the difference between the full value of labor reflected in commodity exchange, and the wages and benefits paid to workers by the capitalist. The capitalist appropriates that surplus value. The price of labor is determined by what is required for its survival and by its own struggles for a greater share of the value it creates. But capitalists, who own the means of production, seek to appropriate the maximum share of the surplus value and to minimize labor’s share.

The economic crisis was precipitated by fraud in the credit sphere. But, economic instability had been building in the sphere of production in the real economy as capital appropriated an ever-greater share of surplus value from labor. Since the Reagan era, the living standards of the working class have suffered a relentless attack. That attack has been focused on undermining labor unions, shifting production to low wage “right to work” states, and destroying the social safety net. The increased exploitation of labor is manifested in longer hours, discrimination, temporary and part-time work, speedup, layoffs, and anti-union employer campaigns.

Points of Unity

* The current ecological crisis results from the capitalist system, which values profits for a global ruling elite over people and the planet. It must therefore be confronted through an international mass movement of working people around the world.

What I am here to say is how the left completely ignores how minorities can be racist. No one cares that Illhan Omar says the Jews hypnotize the world. They're privileged and white so they are clearly in the wrong. They don't care when a black woman goes around spraying people in the face with pepper spray, even when she says its because she hates white people. They don't care when four black teens torture a white man because of his skin tone for almost a full day of suffering. They get out of jail in a few months. When I try to say anything, I am instantly wrong. A black female leaves the room before I can even say three sentences because of how triggering I was mentioning the incident in Chicago. The room tells me that people who were oppressed in history cannot be oppressed now. I asked if the murders in South Africa would be racist and no, because the colonizers.

I dont think that the police are racist as a whole, sure there are a few officers that are racist, but that doesn't mean that the entire police force is racist. And those who are racist and are found of being so are dealt with. I think that the youth of today have been brainwashed by the media into believing that the police are out to kill them. So because they are being told that police are out to kill them, the youth either seek out to kill police, so super sketchy shit around them, or just flat out resist an arrest, speed away at a traffic stop, or are just general dickheads. The media is not only endangering the lives of police officers, but the general public as well. Now this can be said for many things, such as gun control and such but I'm focusing on one thing. Now im no ducksucker to the police, but I am respectful and dont run away from them. I hate hearing people in school talk about how black people are so oppressed by the police, because they definately aren't. It's just the mindset that the media has put the black youth in that makes them BELIEVE that the police are out to get them when that isnt the case at all. I guess that's my view on this, if you think there's something more I should add feel free to reply to this, and if you disagree, let's talk about it! Have a great day you fine people of america.

This is not debatable and has even been admitted to by the companies themselves. We have also seen that these platforms have become the norm for breaking news and is (in theory) a great platform for free speech. I do not disagree that these companies have the right to do what they are doing since it's not like the government is directing them, and you can still post these ideas to your individual websites and such. But because these have become a sort of default mode and are much faster at reaching people than the written word or websites I think that there should be a federally sponsored site that does not allow free speech censorship. Currently the liberal side owns social media and perpetuates many fake news stories. I do not think a government platform would necessarily be more popular than the current platforms, but I think it is important to acknowledged their role in the current political climate and the influence the biases they push on unwilling people. I think it would be fair to have a platform that allowed both sides to speak freely and openly while still reaching millions of people.

I had wanted to do a proper write up on this, but am going to be busy for the next couple weeks and didn't want to lose my train of thought. But I thought maybe this could start a conversation to see what you all think, and maybe revisit it later when I have a little more time in my life.",NH2CO

>The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more  than 66,000 migrants at the Southern border in February, the highest  total for a single month in almost a [decade](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Dec/BP%20Total%20Monthly%20Apps%20by%20Sector%20and%20Area%2C%20FY2000-FY2017.pdf).  
 …  
 Between October and last week, Border  Patrol agents have picked up more than 260,000 people — a 90 percent  jump over the same period a year ago.  
 

The *Washington Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/family-migration-already-at-record-levels-rocketed-to-new-high-in-february/2019/03/05/900b9f42-3f67-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html?utm_term=.fb6886f48294): “Family migration pushes unauthorized crossings to highest levels in a decade,” adding:

>The number of people taken into custody along the Mexico  border jumped an additional 31 percent last month as an unprecedented  mass migration of families from Central America pushes unauthorized  crossings to the highest levels in a decade, according to U.S. Customs  and Border Protection figures released Tuesday.  
 Last month, the shortest of the year, was the busiest [February ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2019/03/04/feature/after-cold-busy-month-at-border-illegal-crossings-expected-to-surge-again/?utm_term=.c72e36fbc79f)at  the border since 2007, officials said, with authorities detaining  76,103 migrants, up from 58,207 in January. The percentage of migrants  who arrived as part of a family group also reached a new peak, with  40,325 parents and children taken into custody, a [67 percent](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration) leap from the previous month.

The *New York Times* played up  the new offer of medical care for the migrants, spotlighted pleas for  aid by pro-migration groups, and only briefly mentioned the incentives  being offered to the migrants by Congress and the courts. “‘Crossing  with a child is a guarantee of a speedy release and an indefinite  release into the United States,’ Mr. McAleenan said.”

The *Times* also was silent about  the harmful economic impact of the migration on Americans and the  economic benefits that flow to business groups.

The *Post*, however, mentioned the ability of migrants to get jobs in the United States, saying:

>An attractive job market in the United  States is prompting more Central Americans to leave the poverty and  insecurity of their home countries and head north, typically in groups  of one parent and one child. Such pairings all but [ensure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-central-americans-children-open-a-path-to-the-us--and-bring-a-discount/2018/11/19/baf3b092-e6ce-11e8-bbdb-72fdbf9d4fed_story.html) the family will be processed quickly and released from U.S. custody in a matter of days.  
 

NPR sympathetically portrayed the migrant aid groups as passive respondents to a humanitarian emergency:

>“It takes an immense effort to do this,” said Ruben  Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, a nonprofit organization in  El Paso, Texas, that provides shelter, food and medical care to migrants  after they’re released from government custody.  
 Most migrants spend just a few days in El Paso, Garcia said, before  joining friends or relatives elsewhere in the country, where they’ll  wait for their day in immigration court.  
 …  
 Humanitarian groups and immigration authorities are bracing for even  more migrants in the months ahead. The number of people crossing the  border illegally typically crests in the spring, as temperatures warm.

I’m a high schooler and I come from a liberal state. The news outlets that I watch mainly cover all of the drama and investigation around Trump rather than what he has actually done as a president. For the past 6ish months I’ve exposed myself to more conservative and libertarian thinking and I’ve found myself to agree more with the conservative/libertarian economic school of thought. Anyway, my question is, what is the most notable policy that the Trump administration has executed, especially in the domestic and economic realms? I already know about corporate tax cuts, the travel ban, the bump stock ban, and the First Step Act, but that’s about it. I’d like to evaluate Trump not just as a person, but a president.

So I just took my first visit over to r/politics and was AMAZED by the lack of republican presence in a subreddit based off of American politics. So I come here instead of being down-voted to oblivion.

The reason I checked in the first place is because I was scrolling through my personal twitter feed and it was completely filled with anti-white people posts. Seeing anti-(insert race here) posts really annoy me and rather than just bypassing them I tend to read through the comments to see what people have to say. This being said the amount of divisiveness that I’ve seen on most social media outlets is sickening. 

If I hadn’t stumbled upon Ben Shapiro before getting into politics I would most likely be a democrat honestly due to social media and the outright misinformation given on it. This worries me because rather than discovering your own personal beliefs, social media spoon feeds what seems to be a democratic narrative in all sorts of ways. 

I came here to ask two things:
1. Is this the general experience on social media or is it most likely because of my young age (as Democrats tend to be younger)?
2. What is the national effect of social media on American politics and will this change as the future generations will grow up with social media?

I consider myself a republican but people keep telling me I'm just copying my parent's views. I disagree with my parents about some things, but not enough to make me consider myself a democrat. I don't hate any particular groups of people and don't oppose gay marriage. I think abortion should be legal up until a certain point when a baby is no longer just a cluster of cells, and I believe that we should enforce more laws to take care of our environment. I support Trump for different reasons like I don't support single payer health care, believe we should crack down on illegal immigrants (I have no problem with legal ones, you just can't cut the line) and generally don't think he's as awful of a guy as people make him out to be. I believe he has done a lot of good for the economy as a whole and has gotten more Americans than ever involved in politics. Also, America has not fallen to pieces like a lot of liberals have predicted and they're mostly just making trouble for themselves and others by stirring up trouble when they shouldn't. I guess I'm a closet Trump supporter. I can't voice my views at school because people just call me stupid, a follower, a bigot, or worse. We're supposed to have debates, but they are always so left that other views are not welcome. I'm afraid it will be the same way at college, especially with recent news of colleges censoring conservative speakers and student groups. 

THE MAIN POINT OF THIS POST:

 Do you guys have any tips on how to be able to withstand pushback on your views? I know I should just ignore them, but is there any other advice? I just want to find a way to feel comfortable enough to share my opinions. Diversity of thought is how you get to the best solutions.",--serotonin--

But yesterday I got an interesting insight into why this clicks with students. 

&#x200B;

I am an online student living with my wife in SC as she attends college. I'm pretty involved with some of the orgs on campus, and many of the students. Yesterday, I was giving a ride back to the dorms to a Freshman who grew up in the same area as me (generally rural and Conservative). Academically he is pretty smart. We got to talking and he mentioned how he has really been enjoying this ""young female who beat all odds and was elected to congress, but I can't always remember her name."" I said ""Oh . . . AOC?"". ""Yes her!! She seems fantastic. She has great passion and she is talking about the things no one else is talking about!"". 

We continued talking and I mentioned some of the basic insanity that is contained within the Green New Deal. He agreed that some of it might be a little crazy, but that she is ""getting the conversation started"". 

&#x200B;

This conversation really scared me. This is how we could potentially elect a president that will fundamentally destroy our nation - by people who are smart but fail to see people like AOC for who they are and what they represent.

The ski resort meeting between [Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif](https://youtu.be/WQdb-omSado)., and the founder of Fusion GPS shows that the House Intelligence Committee chairman is the wrong person to trust with leading a serious, unbiased inquiry.

For more than two years, Schiff has led the fight to make the Russia-collusion narrative stick. But the jig may finally up.

The Russia story, of course, got its start during Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign. Robby Mook, John Podesta, and the rest of the Clinton brain trust did everything they could to sell Americans on it, even paying a group of “consultants” working for Fusion GPS, including a former spy and the wife of a high-ranking DOJ official, to write a “dossier” on then-candidate Trump.

[Trey Gowdy Tore Adam Schiff And Andrew McCabe In Pieces Over Fake Claims Of Russian Collusion](https://youtu.be/WQdb-omSado)

 

Clinton’s team failed to place the dossier, with its lurid and incredible claims, in the media before election 2016. But they did later offer its supposed evidence of collusion with Russia as their excuse for losing to Trump. It ultimately didn’t work, as the American people saw through it.

Schiff has kept up the pressure in Congress that’s led to endless investigative hearings and the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But he may have played a bigger role in all this than anyone realized. Last summer, as John Solomon noted recently, Schiff was spotted openly talking with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson in Aspen, Colorado. This, of course, leads to many new questions about Schiff’s affiliation and involvement with Fusion GPS. Was this the first time he met with Glenn Simpson? What is his past history with one of the more significant characters in the Russia-collusion hoax?

Schiff is still working to hold up the increasingly waterlogged tent of the “collusion” story. He will have to manage public expectations in order to avoid embarrassment when Mueller finally reveals the lack of grounding for charges that the Trump campaign did any of the things Schiff has spent two years insinuating it did.",VeryVeryRight

There would most likely be way worse consequences if he actually admitted that he did it because he wanted to frame Trump and his supporters.
I honestly don't understand why Empire would still have him on the show though, especially now that he kinda tried to throw them under the bus. So it makes sense that now they actually dropped him from the final few episodes.
What he did is kinda disturbing, and really puts into perspective the lengths people will go to just to make a point. I hope though that this will make people start to be more critical of their own political side, no matter which one. ",hoheyalrightok

The  Supreme Court has just put the clamps on states’ ability to  impose  excessive fines and use civil asset forfeiture to seize private   property.

On Wednesday February 20,  2019, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Eight Amendment’s ban on  excessive fines also applies to states. **This  landmark ruling bolsters property rights and could curtail  controversial law enforcement seizures, especially those carried out via  civil forfeiture.**

In the decision, [*Timbs v. Indiana*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2018/17-1091_4h25.pdf),  the Supreme Court sided with small time drug offender Tyson Timbs,  whose $42,000 Land Rover was seized by law enforcement officials. Civil  asset forfeiture is one of the most controversial methods used to raise  revenue across the nation. However, it has garnered considerable  criticism from political figures across the political spectrum.

In a previous case, [*Austin v. United States*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-6073.ZS.html),   the Court ruled that the Eight Amendment, which is clear about its   prohibition of “excessive fines”, limits the federal government’s   ability to seize property. *Timbs v. Indiana* now extends those limits to the states.

For once, Justice Ruth Ginsburg gets it right.  She wrote:

*“The  historical and logical case for concluding that the 14th  Amendment  incorporates the Excessive Fines Clause is overwhelming.”*

Ginsburg drew from Anglo-American legal traditions to rule in Timbs’s favor:

*“For  good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a   constant shield throughout Anglo-American history: Exorbitant tolls   undermine other constitutional liberties.”*

She also presciently noted the potential abuse that excessive fines engender:

“*Excessive fines can be used, for example, to retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies.”*

**In  times of high political polarization it’s great to see the Supreme   Court come to a unanimous decision on civil asset forfeiture. This is   one issue that should unite people from all sides of the political   aisle.**",SuperCharged2000

When asked about why she supported decriminalizing the drug, she said that “*half my family’s from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?”*

It seems she said this unaware that many Jamaicans aren’t thrilled to  see their country associated with the recreational drug- including her  own father, Donald Harris, who immigrated to the United States from the  Caribbean island nation.

Harris condemned his own daughter’s remarks in quite surprising and harsh terms, in a statement provided to [Jamaica Global Online.](https://www.jamaicaglobalonline.com/donald-harris-slams-his-daughter-senator-kamala-harris-for-fraudulently-stereotyping-jamaicans-and-accusing-her-of-playing-identity-politics/) Not  only did he express his disapproval of her comments on marijuana, but  he also went on to take a stab at the identity politics present within  the Democratic Party and Kamala Harris campaign.

Michigan Democrat congresswoman Rashida Tlaib registered to vote from a  false address, and represented a state House district that she did not  actually live in.

Tlaib’s own father even said that Tlaib “lied” about her address in order to run for office.

Here is what the evidence, presented below, proves:

&#x200B;

1. Rashida Tlaib **registered to vote at a false address**  as she embarked on her first political campaign. “Registering to vote  using a false address” is one of a number of crimes that fall into the  voter fraud category.
2. Tlaib ran for and represented the 12th district in the Michigan House of Representatives even though **she was not a resident of that district.**
3. Records show that Tlaib was an “**Absentee Owner**” at the Detroit house she claimed to live in.
4. Tlaib moved to her official Detroit apartment address, which she reported to the FEC after the election, at the start of her 2018  campaign. Her new address was recorded for the first time **one day before she announced her campaign** for Congress…

  

**Tlaib’s father** [**made a series of comments to Charlie LeDuff of The Detroit News**](https://shekel.blogspot.com/2010/03/)**on** [**March 13, 2010**](https://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2010/03/rep_rashida_tlaibs_father_thro.html)**, in an article** [**that no longer has an active ink but exists in the The Detroit News archives:**](https://www.detroitnews.com/errors/404/#ixzz0i4l3DMqT)",SuperCharged2000

Riverside County Superior Court judge Helios Hernandez, appointed by Democrat governor Gray Davis, ordered [624](http://theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/) wiretaps in 2014, [almost](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/) five times more than any other American judge, and 44,000 people and over 2 million conversations were tapped. Hernandez even [got 17 wiretap applications](http://www.prosecutorialaccountability.com/2016/03/03/ca-riverside-countys-massive-wiretapping-binge-faces-its-first-court-challenge/) in one day. Some of Hernandez’s wiretaps [have been found to be illegal by prosecutors](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151214/08492533071/dea-loses-big-drug-case-thanks-to-illegal-wiretap-warrants-prosecutor-calls-procedural-errors.shtml), leading to the dropping of some cases and the surrender of assets seized by the feds. A [federal judge said](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/crime_courts/2016/07/06/riverside-county-wiretaps-judge/86779116/) legal standards “could not have been met” with regard to the Riverside County wiretaps. [Approximately 18 percent](https://www.pe.com/2017/07/02/wiretaps-drop-from-outsized-high-in-inland-empire/) of the more than 4 million conversations wiretapped in the state of California in 2016 were incriminating.

The wiretapping scheme coincided with a period of massive revenue gains for the state of California from civil asset forfeitures overseen by Kamala Harris’ office. In 2014, Riverside County [collected more than $3 million](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/publications/asset_forf/2014_af/counties-2014.pdf) in civil asset forfeitures.",SuperCharged2000

Actually go out into your community and help. Don't donate money. Donate something much more valuable; your time.  Dont post about it on social media. Go get your hands dirty with your neighbors, but let's see which hat can do a better job. Red vs Blue put on a purple hat whatever. Once you put it on you are in service to your community mode. Fight over who can build a playground better. Who can deliver more food to the elderly. Firing off angry tweets about what a hat means to you doesn't do much.

&#x200B;

Is it possible the left is not as ""secure"" as they would wish you to believe? I must say, I did not have a ""visceral"" reaction to the covington video. I immediately knew something wasn't right, and context is being hidden.

&#x200B;

This feeling allowed me to hold off judgement, emotion and the desire to signal for ""a side"".  When the second video came out it justified my skeptisism. It was obvious that Nathan Phillips (Native American w/ a still in question service record) who was beating a drum inches from a 16 year olds face... approached the kids, with a couple others in tow (I want there identities).

&#x200B;

Let's also not forget that NATHAN PHILLIPS approached the kids with an ""intent"". That in itself is the definition of ""aggressor"".  Or an offensive mindset. The kids were waiting for a school bus and were in a defensive mindset (don't forget they are 14-16 year olds) already because black Israelites were harassing the kids.

&#x200B;

This video is obvious to sniff out for anyone with a rational mind. Yet, representatives like Ilhan Omar doubled down.

&#x200B;

Herself on Twitter... 

&#x200B;

Why on earth would a politician double down on something that anyone with a rational mind can understand? Personally it insults my intelligence. Therefore,  It must be desperation. There must be unrest within the democratic party. I think the democratic party is going through an identity crisis right now.

&#x200B;

I think right now, the Republican party needs to come together more then ever.  Trump is going to have to expand his speeches and become more nuanced. He is going to have to include more ideals into his policies. Hardline conservative values will not win him re-election. The left are organized and essentially dominate social and mainstream media / comedy channels.

&#x200B;

if y'all wish to see inner turmoil, then look no further then r/enough_sanders_spam  (I think this is the beginning).

&#x200B;

The Covington coverage showed something. The left elites are as irrational as ever. Don't be fooled by their status or there backing.

8592,"So, everything you think about what happened at that ""protest"" in DC that you read about this morning is wrong. No, Catholic boys did NOT harass a Native American. Here's the run-down.",21,ahw5yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/ahw5yg/so_everything_you_think_about_what_happened_at/,4,2019-01-20 11:52:38,"The reason I'm giving you the run-down is in hopes you will read and digest it and because I'm pissed because I believed the lie this morning.

I saw a snippet of a video and thought, ""Those kids should not be blocking that Native American man like that!""

What I did not know is that they did NOT block that Native American man.  They were waiting for a bus doing school cheers and shit and the guy decided he needed to charge into the middle of their group.

They had no idea what was going on.  The native guy marched up to the one kid, who thought he was being ""interactive""... but then the folks WITH the native American guy started talking about how the white kids were on stolen land and needed to go back to Europe.

Previously, they had encountered a group of black nationalist protestors who had been insisting that America was a homosexual nation because the Romans and Greeks were homosexual.

In short, you had a group of kids who encountered a group of professional protestors.  Those professionals then captured misleading video to serve their purpose.

""But I saw it with my own eyes..."" you say.

""But you didn't see all of it.""  I say.

What are those kids guilty of?  Doing school chants and dancing to the drumming.  Standing face to face with a guy who had marched into their group with a drum.  They had no idea who he was or what he wanted.  There's NOTHING on video that shows them chanting, ""Build the wall"" as is alleged.  And there's video of all of it.  Oh yeah.  I'm going to put it at the bottom of this post.

Because that Viet Nam Vet is now all over the media saying he's still trying to process how SCARED he was about these Trump Jugend looking at him... 

After he deliberately walked into the middle of their group.  This guy is CRYING in the media over something he instigated.  He's saying, ""We welcome everyone.  This is indigenous land.  We don't build walls...""  But the people WITH him were telling the MAGA kids that they needed to go back to Europe.  THAT'S right and you'll hear it in the videos I link.

So everyone saw a snippet this morning and jumped to conclusions as did major media.  I'd like to think that at the WaPo...MAYBE...a writer said, ""But all we have is a tiny moment on tape...perhaps we should investigate this further..."" before some editor bellowed, ""Write the story about how the scary Hitler Youth terrorized the innocent Native American elder Viet Nam vet with a stare-off because they have hate in their hearts!""

And now... the moment you've all been waiting for, but will probably downvote:

The Native American marched into THEIR group:

https://twitter.com/blairanton/status/1086747076065517568

Here's more video of the whole thing including people telling whites to go back to Europe and concluding with the group of black men that insulted the students and harassed their black classmate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npX801xLSFY&feature=youtu.be&app=desktop

Bear in mind this is after the elder marched INTO their group.

Apparently, they had no idea what was going on.

Guy who was approached had no idea the elder wasn't friendly.

And late in the video you can hear the person recording say something like, ""What is happening?""

Media malpractice.  That's what was happening.

Here's a statement from a kid that was there.

https://twitter.com/AClementsWKRC/status/1086822521012473858

Now... these videos are being downvoted all across reddit.

Don't claim you want the truth if you are trying to hide it.

I think Gen Powell said it best. 

""Good leadership involves responsibility to the welfare of the group, which means that some people will get angry at your actions and decisions.  It's inevitable if you're honorable. Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity: You'll avoid the tough decisions, you'll avoid confronting the people who need to be confronted, and you'll avoid offering differential rewards based on differential performance because some people might get upset. Ironically, by procrastinating on the difficult choices, by trying not to get anyone mad, and by treating everyone equally ""nicely"" regardless of their contributions, you'll simply ensure that the only people you'll wind up angering are the most creative and productive people in the organization"".

Many people think the wall is inhumane or a waste. But the truth is it isn't a waste at all. 5B dollars is not much at all considering the effects that that money will go to. 

**The Effects** 

Illegal immigrants cost us 135B dollars a year according to the U.S taxpayers. We only get back about 19B dollars worth of taxes from them, money being wasted on people who either illegally crossed or overstayed. If we can get this wall up than we can cut the budget of immigration and put it into other things like homeless veterans or homeless citizens, America first. 

**Why It Should Be Built**

Considering how our money is being wasted on aliens we need the wall for that reason too. Not all of it is people who crossed the border on foot but a good portion is. A lot of drugs are being smuggled into the U.S by crossing the border a year. Illegal immigrants are 2x more likely to commit crimes than a U.S citizen, another reason why we need the wall.

**Other Solutions For Immigration**

Abide by the law, don't overstay your visa. A lot of immigrants overstay visas and we end up paying their welfare and they give us little to nothing in return. We need to deport the ones who don't abide by the law and who overstay visas. If you want a opportunity in the U.S do it legally. But I do think that the process should be quicker so people should have a good opportunity here, but not illegally",noanimepoliceman

But after looking into it in every state it is illegal to make you own alcohol wether it’s for personal use or for selling. But I just have to ask why? I mean if it’s because they want to protect us from the dangers of making your own alcohol then I can almost see that.

Russia, since the early 1900's, has adopted a policy of maskirovka(masking), or Russian military deception. This includes camouflage, denial, and deception. ""Deceptive measures include concealment, imitation with decoys and dummies, manoeuvres intended to deceive, denial, and disinformation."" In other words, Russia is happy to take your money for any information you want as long as it isn't the truth. One wonders if our illustrious intelligence services know this? Comey? Mueller? Were they acting in good faith? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_deception

""Fruit of the poisonous tree is a legal metaphor in the United States used to describe evidence that is obtained illegally. The logic of the terminology is that if the source (the ""tree"") of the evidence or evidence itself is tainted, then anything gained (the ""fruit"") from it is tainted as well. ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree In other words, all investigations and evidence that are result of the alleged, fraudulent dossier should be excluded from evidence in court. All convictions stemming from said evidence and investigations should be dismissed or overturned. This includes Trump himself and all the people around him that were investigated in connection to Russian collusion.

I'm pro-American, and as such, support Trump. 

I'm an SF resident and read the PolitiFacts article last night regarding a meme floating around showing a mansion, being used to critique Pelosi's anti-wall stance. Essentially saying ""Why do you live in a walled community if walls are immoral?"". Everyone here knows Pelosi lived in the only walled community in SF for many years. Its in their marketing, its in her books, and its part of SF lore for most. The place was even originally built for whites to keep minorities out. So I decided to comment that they were correct the specific SF mansion shown was not hers, but she did in fact live in a walled community right down the street and it was a bit extreme to label the meme with their most falsifying qualifier. I saw the article using semantics to narrate their claims unjustly, and gave them the benefit of the doubt at first. That was until I was dismissed.

Would I choose arguing about Pelosi once living in a walled community as my hill to die on? Hell no. Its stupid and Americans should live where they choose, walls or not. I only share this so you guys can see as I did, there was ZERO research in this article, and the content of which becomes more and more based on nothing or hearsay, maybe because their sources were a facebook post and fly-by-night news website. This is supposed to be a bipartisan fact-checking site, and they dismiss me with 'my sources say'. Data talks. I didn't save a copy of the article last night, but if anyone has a way to access a cached version somehow, I'd be curious to see if they silently changed the article. It seems smaller but this is pure speculation on my part.

**The Process**

Wait till what i have to say about what is done, just cruel. Dr. Antony Levatino once described this at a Judiciary Committee in 2015. He is a ex-worker for Planned Parenthood who was done over 1200 abortions, late term. The process is to remove limbs such as arms, legs and even squashing these poor babies heads.

The staffer has asked that they remain anonymous to better answer questions about the campaign. The Mod staff has verified their identity/credentials and is who they claim to be.

[Here is a link to the last AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/6iwc2l/i_was_a_senior_staff_member_on_a_winning_gop_us/)

We are very greatful to NSS for volunteering their time, effort, and experience. And so you know, NSS has staffed for several politicians that many on this sub support and hold in extremely high regard. (No, it's not Kasich) and don't play guessing games. If the identity of any of the politicians NSS has worked for come to light, the game is over and NSS can't answer as straightforward as they'd like. And believe me it is figuratively killing me not being able to tell you who that is so please don't make it worse. If you have ever wondered what it's like to play in the big leagues of politics, now is your chance to find out.

One final note:

We would like to extend our hand to other republican leaning subs to come take a gander and participate. We don't mind people advertising this but we do ask that you not post this on sub that are in direct opposition to republican values or view republicans in a negative light. Such actions will be viewed as attempting to brigade the AMA. When in doubt, please ask us mods first.


We will be using this post as a question workshop all week where us mods will help work through wordings of questions.  [Like we did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaRepublican/comments/6he9ag/ama_question_workshop/)

In said video, I called those who believe in gun control “libtards.” This did not go over well.

I made a second video apologizing for using divisive rhetoric in the first which went over even worse.  

The leftists mostly ignored the fundamental arguments of my videos and instead attacked me on my personal appearance, told me I’m a waste of time, called me a psychopath, and, I hate to admit it, but some of it got under my skin. 

I really just want to bring people together to protect my state from globalist agenda but the response I got was so negative that I feel pretty discouraged right now.  I’m still going to keep fighting for what I believe in and pushing out content even if I continue to get called a loser by my own people. But it just feels bad to know that the people of Maine would so quickly reject libertarian values in favor of democratic-socialist ones.  

I fear that Portland, Maine, will soon look like Portland, Oregon. Be weary of the leftists my friends.",JSals

So disrespectful!

Is it possible this is a result of twitter prioritizing liberal posts? Maybe there is a group that puts people up to spamming the twitter. Perhaps paid or volunteer. Maybe it is a bot? These people seem obsessed with hating our president. Those replies do not represent how the country feels about our president. I don’t like Obama, but I stay away from his twitter page.

The Trump administration has offered a proposed rule that, if implemented, would make it less likely for foreign citizens who access welfare to receive a green card.

The proposed rule is published and open for public comment. So far, open-borders advocates have flooded the federal register with their comments in opposition to the proposal. Please leave your comment by clicking here:

[https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001)

Here are some suggested talking points you can include in your comment:

* **Express support for the public charge rule!**
* Welfare use among immigrant households is already high. A recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies found that 63% of non-citizen households, approximately 4.6 million, use welfare.
* The Migration Policy Institute confirms this finding. According to its research, 47.2% of non-citizens receive at least one type of the four major public benefits -- cash assistance, SSI, food stamps, and Medicaid/CHIP.
* The average immigrant household costs U.S. taxpayers $6,234 each year in federal welfare benefits.

**ABOUT THE 'PUBLIC CHARGE' RULE**

The administration's proposed rule simply strengthens the already existing rule that defines what welfare programs USCIS can consider in determining if a green card applicant is likely to become a public charge.

The existing rule is limited to cash assistance and institutionalization for long-term care. The [proposed rule](http://hub.numbersusa.com/route/8/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81/1721505/9?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001) would include food stamps, public housing, and Medicaid, among other programs.

New analysis of government data from the Center for Immigration Studies finds that 63% of non-citizen headed households access some form of welfare. You can read more about their findings by [clicking here](http://hub.numbersusa.com/route/9/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81/1721505/9).

>The ""gilets jaunes"" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, are complaining at a sharp increase in diesel taxes.

>Mr Macron says his motivation for the increase is environmental, but protesters call him out of touch - particularly with non-city dwellers who rely on their cars.

People are questioning the left and carbon offset taxes, so clearly the Alt Right and Russia are to blame, gnome sane?

What's the over/under on this? 2 weeks?

Here we see Facebook being blamed... and if you read between the lines a little... well...

>The emerging pattern – leaderless protest networks developing on U.S.-owned platforms; meme-like narratives fueling popular indignation; nebulous, quickly radicalizing, demands fueled by lots of underlying anger – led Russian President Vladimir Putin to suspect the U.S. of organizing action in different parts of the world according to the same playbook.

Elementary should be somewhere where a student should find their talent, not go to school and get piles of hw or don’t really find their talent. Where elementary should be like that. Furthermore if middle schools and high schools were joined to be just one public gov funded Academic school focused on subjects that the student is interested in. 

For example a academy made for writers or any academy made for students who enjoy math like a Academic Academy for Mathematics and Logic, which these academies will be more focused on a specific subject instead of multiple subjects students won’t use in their adult lives. So if anyone had any thought negative or positive I’m all ears

If the politicians want to stall the bill from passing or outright vote to not pass such a bill, then not having the aid money is only their fault to blame.

This is my first post in this subreddit and I couldn’t be more embarrassed that my school offers a course on impeaching Donald Trump. Apparently this is the second semester in a row they’re offering the course and just to give you a better idea of what the class is about, this is what the class details say: 

San Diego State University is offering a one-unit course in March called “Trump: Impeachment, Removal or Conviction?” taught by Professor John Joseph Cleary.

“Focus will be on the two constitutional grounds: impeachment and removal (25th Amendment), and the possible charges of the independent counsel,” the course description reads in part.

The class will cover “grounds for impeachment, removal, or indictment” such as “conflict of interests, foreign emoluments, climate change, racism, religious bias, improper influence, nepotism, and a host of crimes, including conspiracy, false statements, and obstruction of justice”

I’m actually at a loss for words, I don’t know how a college institution, let alone SDSU, would back such a painstakingly obvious biased class. I am very disappointed in my college for allowing lies and false accusations to be spread in a legitimate class. I have always been scared of teachers exerting their political opinions on kids without them realizing they’re being influenced, but for a “teacher” to be suggesting and teaching that Donald Trump should be impeached without any evidence or fair representation of both sides is ludicrous and dangerous for young adults who are supposed to be forming their own beliefs at this stage in their lives. Especially when it’s being offered as curriculum. I just feel bad for all the sheep getting brainwashed at this school, yet I get so angry because of them. Half of the students aren’t adept enough to do their own research and form their own opinion. Instead they opt for the force feeding of pure bullshit, compliments of the left.  Is it so hard to ask for people to just WAKE UP and start paying attention to what is actually going on around them. Sorry for the rambling and kind of jumping around from point to point. Just thoroughly disappointed in the growing gap between these two “political parties” and the deceit fueling the separation. ",SpecialK69_

My girlfriend and I, can NO longer take the uncivilized ways of liberalism. I grew up in Brooklyn and New Jersey when it was still an american place to live. We enjoyed the diners, the plentiful jobs and remember a time when a commoner would still speak English. Everything is different today. Slowly and slowly all the old native New Yorkers have left. Our towns today are runned down due to rapid immigration, ghetto thugs moving in and quite frankly they have no manners. The property taxes are off the charts due to many illegals sending their kids to school here- and of course we have to foot the tax bill. The politicians here don’t care either, they just want to fill their pockets. Plus if you’re white male here- and a conservative- then you get a sense of feeling you don’t belong. Alienation is very apparent. There are very few whites left in NJ at this point. At my work in nyc where more and more ppl are moving from California/San Francisco- things are changing  on daily basis. There is a clear divide where I work.  Many of my co-workers have left due to disrespectful new millennials..we are considering moving out to another state. I was wondering if you guys could comment about another city which might be comparative to living standards in north jersey/nyc. Pay cut is fine, at this point we just need a nice homely city/suburb- where people are polite, jobs are abundant, and starting a new family is feasible. Even swing cities and states would work. We are middle class educated conservatives- not extremely religious either- funny thing is we used to Democrats.

Thanks for reading. 

PS. In past 5 years- NY,NJ and CT had the highest net out migration. It has been happening before Trump got in power. ",alpha1177

How much does it cost?  How much do routine medical things (routine bloodwork, x-rays etc...) cost?

I know this is something that either political party could answer, but from what I peripherally understand... the democrats do not like how healthcare is done and Republicans do?

I would really love to know the pros and cons, if it's affordable and in general how it all works?

Sorry if this is the wrong sub to ask this.

Coming of age during the Reagan administration, I've considered myself a Republican most of my life. But now I've been perplexed concerning this new media avenue I've found myself in. Which begets the following questions.

**  Certain boards do not allow articles from certain news outlets. The best example I've found was r/democrats does not allow articles from Fox News or the New York Post. (I'm sure they disallow more and they are not the only board that does this)
 
- - Does this board dictate the same rules? Do you allow articles from all forms of the MSM? 

It seems discussion regarding issues which are polar to a particular board would be welcome and enlightening. Plus, searching for facts or criticism against a particular group allows context and further understanding in one's position. I don't  believe I could bring myself to outright eliminate someone else's views because they don't match my own. 

**  Which brings me to Rule 4 on this board - ""do not post anti-Republican submissions or comments"". 

- -  Can we not question an article or vett an issue published in the MSM even though the article in question is critical of Republican ideas?

It would seem the best place to express ideas, pass on facts or widen understanding of a particular issue would be to post and debate defamatory publications. Every person may align themselves with a specific political idea or party, but each has their own version of morals and scruples. Examining all of those foundations can bring on a topic or view not thought of. 

I thank you all in advance for allowing such a sophomoric question regarding Reddit rules. You help in this matter is greatly appreciated.",stonekrab1

OK, probably happens every once in awhile, there's millions of people who participated and  mistakes happen.

 Just treat those ""found"" ballots like any other for tabulation, including archiving the voters identification as to vet the validity of the vote.

Can't we ensure that close races can't be exploited by a a preengineered surprise introduction of more votes to tip the tally by overseeing it all? 

How can wr confirm how the ballots became isolated to begin with , and isn't there a procedure to ensure those votes , and I suppose all votes that are not in-person , are assignable to a valid voter to prevent the simple fabrication of Fraudulent ballots ?",kko-caykoh

I changed my address online this afternoon from Martin County FL to Palm Beach County FL.  The system let me do it and said it should be processed in 1-2 business days.  What happens now if the process is not finished prior to Tuesday?  Did I miss up big-time by trying to change my voting address this close to an election?  I'm afraid that, with the update, I may not be able to vote if it is still pending.  I even read something that if it does go through you may have to still vote at your old address polling location, but I cannot confirm.

If anyone has an answer or any kind of advice I would really appreciate it.  Thanks in advance!",Jftaran

Was always one of the things I strongly agreed with the democratic party on.....


Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in 1993: ""The day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is gone. We simply can't afford it.""

Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in 2007: ""I happen to think that the Congress should be spending a lot more time discussing this issue and making it easier for us to create decent paying jobs for American workers instead of allowing corporate interest to drive wages down by importing more and more people into this country to do the work that Americans should be doing.""

Example comment:  Right winger crazies feel safer in their hatred and bigotry now because of the orange leader and they are becoming more outspoken. It’s leading to more violence from the right and they now feel justified in their misplaced anger. Like it’s their time. 

So what I want to ask is: how do you respond to this vitriol? How do you respond to people who place at your feet suffering and death that you had no part in because you lean a certain way?

I know that ending the war on drugs is more of a libertarian opinion, but do any of you agree it is a waste of our tax dollars to house and feed drug addicts in prisons? We are already over spending. Would it be more beneficial to make these drugs legal and tax them? We take almost all of the profits away from cartels. Less junkies dying from unclean drugs. More of a chance for junkies to seek help become clean and actually contribute to society. It just seems like we are running in circles and throwing millions of dollars at it. Do you think crime would decrease in poverty ridden neighborhoods? Or would they just find another means of making money illegally? Thanks for any and all opinions on this subject",420boofit

Bush and supply-side economics: a 38-year old left-wing myth, based on some sloppy MEDIA coverage",0,9qftdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/9qftdg/george_hw_bush_and_supplyside_economics_a_38year/,0,2018-10-22 20:10:06,"Hi all, new here. Great to find a subreddit by and for Republicans! :)

There's this persistent myth - arguably, outright lie - that George H.W. Bush called supply-side economics ""Voodoo Economics."" In fact, ""**41"" NEVER said that about supply-side economics.** *He was referring to the Kemp-Roth tax cut proposal specifically and many of Reagan's economic policies in general* \- more specifically, Reagan's promise of large, sweeping tax cuts that Reagan argued would end up increasing revenue, at the same time that Reagan was proposing a massive increase in the defense budget.

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edchtf9MS7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edchtf9MS7g)

\^\^Watch this entire clip - but specifically, right about 6 minutes in. Bush says, basically, **""We've got to get the budget in balance by reducing expenditures, get in balance by a $20 billion SUPPLY-SIDE (Bush's emphasis) tax cut, and THEN begin to reduce rates.""** Note that Bush then talks about the perils of endangering investor confidence, being ""already as low at it is"", with ""risking a massive increase in the budget deficit"" - and potentially, even higher inflation. This, more or less, was Bush's view.

As can also be seen in this clip, Bush argued that Reagan was overpromising with his proposals and that Reagan's extremely ambitious plans would unnecessarily increase the federal debt at a time when budget deficits, inflation, and unemployment were ALREADY out-of-control (no thanks to decades of reckless Democrat-driven government handouts, welfare policies, massive federal budgets that were wasteful, unaccountable, and prone to fraud and corruption - culminating in Jimmy Carter's utterly ruinous tenure).

Now, Bush was mostly mistaken in his concerns, from my POV and judging by Reagan's record once in office, but I can totally understand his skepticism from the context of the times; Reagan was indeed taking some massive risks with his plans, but they definitely did pay off in the end, to everyone's benefit! :)

Going back to the title of my thread, though; the broader point is that some sloppy, bad journalism at the time can morph into this myth that Bush actually disagreed with Reagan on most issues, or that he opposed supply-side economics as a rule before he became Reagan's Vice President, or that indeed, ""Voodoo Economics"" was a dig at supply-side economics (which Reagan also subscribed to, obviously), not Reagan's SPECIFIC policy proposals or Reagan's endorsement of Kemp-Roth.

Remember: never trust the conventional wisdom of the liberal elite opinion-makers and myth-makers. This is a good case study of that. They have it out for Republicans and conservatives in general, they want us to fail, and they'll use any piece of ""evidence"" to divide and conquer us - no matter how flimsy or untrue. Always be on guard against them.

The clips are showing large mobs working their way towards US - Mexico border.  
I’m sure many of the pictures are staged as they get them clogging together to cross a bridge or walkway. Always in large mobs. 
Just trying to overload our system and force Administrations hand regarding family separation right before midterms. I find it awfully hard to believe they just got the idea “hey this seems like a good time”.  Interviews have central theme of NO JOBS. Geezus that’s the best they got? 
The optics of which only will benefit the Democrats likely hoping they get separated families.

You are trying to tell me that what's happening to Kavanaugh is better than what happened to Merrick Garland and this is fair.

But I'm not a 20 something gender studies major. I remember what you guys have done.

You tried something AKIN to this on Clarence Thomas.

And failed.

You borked Bork. You tried to libel Thomas.

And you are crying because Merrick Garland was subject to the Biden rule? Who ever brought 11th hour allegations against Merrick Garland? They just didn't consider him. He doesn't need armed guards at his home because there are death threats against him and rape threats towards his children.

https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/02/16/chuck-schumer-supreme-court-nomination-president-sot-erin.cnn/video/playlists/supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-dead/

There's your boy Chucky Schumer talking about how what happened with Garland was ""policy"".

Look... I knew you were reprehensible when some guy tried to assassinate Republicans on a ball field and you identified with the guy saying, ""What do Republicans expect when they take away healthcare?"" ""I'm surprised it took THIS LONG for someone to try to kill them."" And even, ""Too bad his aim was so bad... we might have the majority if he had killed more of them.""

Auntie Maxine is calling for ""absolutely harassing"" people.

And you blamed Palin for the Giffords shooting because she put a ""target"" on that district. A practice that Daily Kos engaged in when it came to Republicans.

Keep it up Democrats. Just Bork yourselves.

Please note that I do believe Dr. Ford was sexually assaulted. I am not saying she was not.

What I am saying is this: we do need a standard in our society. So if the presumption of innocence only matters and only applies to the court of law. Then what is the standard outside the court of law? Are we to assume everyone is guilty until they can prove their own innocence? Or only assume guilt when it is convenient to ourselves and our own narratives? 

These questions matter. For example: if someone were to call my boss today, and tell them that I raped them should my boss fire me? If they told my friends, should they stop talking to me? If they told my parents should their hearts break and they think that they failed as parents? They they all assume I am guilty unless I can disprove these claims?

It feels like everyone's always wrong no matter what, and I'm not sure I want to live in a world where just voicing my opinion makes people hate me as a person just because it's not their opinion.

Everyone is in essence roasting Kavanaugh on all my social medias, and for all I know he could be a guy getting labeled as a drunk, racist, rapist and his family has to go through that. He has kids, he has a wife and he's been thrown into this. I can't stand that the media seems to be ganging up on him, and instantly believing what just a few people have accused him of.

I've been looking for a possibility to debate someone from the left side of the isle on internet, mostly because I acknowledge my weak understanding of politics and desire to change the situation.
I found few people, and I pm them. Some of them were open to share their views but very soon shut themselves up after my contr-arguments.

Every time I write about politics somewhere I get downvoted very hard, presumably by bots, but also by lefties.
But they never want to have a civil debate - get very offensive sometimes.

If you recommend me to find one in real life, then - where? 

But I want to use reddit avatar for right now, just to get more experience and make sure I understand politics well enough to not be afraid to open my mouth in public.

It does not stop there. She responded to it.


From Julia,
> Hi Stephen. I do not personally manage my website. I explained in my statement yesterday that a staffer who wrote the language in one platform page (written in first-person) mistakenly said this. I asked that it be corrected as soon as I was alerted to it yesterday morning.

The problem is there is a video of her saying she is an immigrant.

More campaigning on your ""identity"" as an ""immigrant.""
""I immigrated to this country with my family when I was very little. In Colombia, my mom raised me as a single mother..."" 0:37 seconds in.

We will vote for DeSantis for Republican candidate for Governor because President Trump endorsed him over Putnam.
Did Trump endorse any other candidates on this ballot?
Looks like Frank White is the pro Trump Attorney General candidate over Ashley Moody as the establishment Republican.
Agriculture Commissioner Republican candidate Matt Caldwell has the NRA endorsement.
( Agriculture commission handles concealed carry permits in Florida)
What about the candidates for Judge?
It’s non partisan, so they can’t say which party they belong to. I would just vote for Republicans as I think they would generally be tougher on crime, more pro life and more gun friendly.
I have Group 13, 18 and 25 on my ballot. I have been to ALL their websites and they all have the same words about skills, justice and fairness.
Even the scientist candidate says she has skills, while her rival is a public defender. 
It’s like it is secret information whether they even belong to a political party. 
I’ve searched the net and there is no one issuing recommendations for judge candidates. I see Tea party recommendations for Texas, but none in Florida.
Anyone have any ideas on who rates these people? Any way to find out if they are Republicans?

Hello fellow Republicans! I am a Republican who loves debate. However, if you look at rule 1, debate is not allowed. I am not complaining about this, as debate would encourage trolling from your opposition all over this sub. However, if any of you guys are interested in debating your beliefs with people who have opposing viewpoints in an environment where everyone is required to be respectful, please consider partaking in discussions on my new [subreddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/Debatocratics/). If you wish to gather a group of like-minded people within your community before heading over, please feel free to do so.

If you hate debate, and it gives you a headache, you don't have to come. However, I firmly believe that healthy debate is necessary for democracy to function, and by debating with your peers you make the world a much better place.",LockeThot

Regarding legalization of marijuana, I haven’t heard much regarding republican views. To me, it sound like a win-win situation. State  makes money off its taxes, ilegal sell decreases, no more people who  are incarcerated for possession of it   have to spend unnecessary time in prison which means that tax payers’ money can be redirected to amore useful causes. Plus is less deadly than alcohol and tabaco which are both legal. I want to see (glance) at what a general republican opinion looks like. Whether you support it or not or are undecided.

>I’ve been so inspired by the #WalkAway campaign that I'm getting over my fear and adding my voice. It’s such a shame what’s happening to our country. I’ve seen this quote in several places recently and it resonates with me enough to try and paraphrase it here: if your love for your country hinges on who is president, then you don’t love your country. I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I’ve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left. To vocalize any kind of dissenting opinion that doesn't fall in lock/step with “the war for social justice” gets us labeled a nazi, bigot, or some other kind of racist— sometimes by our own families. So here's my contribution to this movement. From one lifelong Democrat, here to say No More. I’m nowhere near Conservative, nowhere near Republican, but I’m still breaking up with my party. No more rabid cognitive dissonance, no more exaltation of victimhood-- I’ve chosen to #WalkAway. - Vanessa Berben

Many of those elections will be for national-level seats in the US House and US Senate.

Many voters will take advantage of early voting to avoid the crowds at the polls.

In the two or three weeks before election day, we will witness a time-honored American tradition: the October surprise.

Our various Intelligence Agencies have stated that the Russians are going to try to influence the 2018 election.  This shouldn't be a shock to us - they (and their predecessor, the Soviet Union) have been meddling in US politics for the better part of a century.

Its just a lot easier now between social media and the near-complete control by the left of broadcast media, and the President who told our cybersecurity folks to stand down when he was told in 2016 that the Russians were meddling in the election wasn't a Republican.

Fortunately we've been assured over and over again by our Intelligence Agencies that the Russians' efforts in 2016 failed, and that they weren't able to change any votes.  Their influence operations were largely conducted *after* the election, to sow dissent.

It is not in the Russians' interest for the US Congress to have a large Republican Majority, especially not if it is in both chambers.

As such, keep these things in mind when the inevitable October Surprises begin to roll in against Republican candidates:

1. The entire point of an October Surprise is to get you to react emotionally to information about which the whole story is not known.  The in-depth reporting that might exonerate a candidate (especially a Republican involved in an election) might not come out for weeks or months.  The MSM would rather report the politically-convenient lie than the politically-inconvenient truth.

2. It has been demonstrated that 40 year old accusations that can't be proven make effective ""October Surprise"" material, with willing and enthusiastic participation by the leftist press.  Expect more of this.  They know it works.",keypuncher

We led the pushback of the Nazi, the Japanese empire, and ended Osama Bin Laden.  We brought the Air Plane, the steel ship, and the Internet to the word.  We touched down on the moon and sparked the flame of Representative democracy in the British empire.

I’m proud that, as a nation, we can tell our leaders to go fuck themselves, without fear of being locked up in a dark hole for the rest of my life.  I can choose what career path I take and the person marry.  More so my wife can choose those same things.  

My children have never known a day of hunger and will know how to defend themselves and others with the means protected under a constitution purpose built to prevent tyrants from reigning longer than 8 years.  We are nation of unwanted poor and huddled masses and we took that to become the most powerful nation ever ever.  And for however long God will, may it be a beacon of capitalism and democracy.

Asian Americans usually have higher incomes and more education than almost every other group. The vast majority are legal immigrants or were born in the US. They are really big on hard-work, meritocracy, education, and family values. Moreover, it always seems like the Democrats consistently turn a blind eye to their issues in favour of other minorities. For example, affirmative action.

So then why did more than 70% of them vote for Obama/Hillary? 

Where I'm from, the right-wing parties have no problem attracting votes from ethnic minorities.

Ol' man Bernie fights for *the* people \[making 20 times more than *the* people\]. But this article is less about hating a successful person. I hate when we are mad at people for being successful. This is already a society that punishes each other for succeeding (earn more, get taxed more). The battle against Bernie is a battle against hypocrisy.* Carin*g for the working class WHILE making 700k more than what being defined as the 1&#37; AND not redistributing any of his wealth. The fact that Bernie is named the savior of the Dem party is just showing of their mismanagement in message and highlights the lack of integrity in their base.

It is pretty sad that I have had to suppress my beliefs in school out of fear for my grades in pursuit of higher education. Since I am a part of a younger generation I use thing like Snapchat and Instagram and it is amazing how hard the left wing agenda is pushed the amount of news you see on Trump alone is insane. At one point in time if you wanted to find a article about trump you could find at least 2 on Snapchat everyday. Then the gun control stories get me as well. Because I am gun loving American I am hated and thought of as less of a human being by some people. Seriously for it being called the tolerant left they are some of the most intolerant people on the face of this planet. Long story short it is sad that I have to suppress my political views because these lefty’s that think that it’s okay to re write definitions of words like feminism, sexism and racism to fit their needs.

But recently I have made a comment on an instagram post about how I do not support illegal immigration and I was harassed by an atheist who have said the most hurtful things that I have ever heard of about my religion. I don't understand why he did that when the post was about illegal immigration.  But so far when I make a post In support of a liberal or democratic point of view I get a bunch of likes and a lot of support.  Again I am so sorry I did not understand what you guys were going through until I walked a mile in your shoes. ,Amirasalam123

I’m 33 years old white male who keeps track of the news regarding the state of our nation and I have a bone to pick with you all. Many of you have gotten to the point that you think it is okay to attack a person’s character because you feel you can judge someone based off their political leaning, labeling them terms that only reserve for the truly despicable individuals. Then you proceed use this as justification to attack them and anyone associate with them in the worst possible approach to make their arguments invalid regardless how it effects their lives. You whack the hornet nest and throw it at your foes to cause them as much harm possible which is beyond evil, using the mob to do your dirty bidding in attempt to tear them down.


This horrible behavior is only reserved for mentally abusive individuals except you do it on a national scale towards anyone who doesn’t agree with your views. You are that abusive partner we have to deal with daily who makes us feel inadequate and unable to love ourselves. “NONSENSE,” I can hear you say, but sadly it is true and it is getting worse by the day. Do let me take a moment to explain and list-off the signs you are in an abusive relationship.

---

1.) You walk on eggshells to avoid disappointing your partner.


“You’re second-guessing and self-editing, which means you’ve internalized the subtly abusive behavior so that your partner doesn’t have to do it overtly.”  ― Steven Stosny, psychologist and author of Love Without Hurt


Average Americans citizens and Independent or Republican Politicians feel that they must watch what they post or say in fear that they will be labeled something that can ruin their ability to form relationships, protect their family, or keep their job. What they say doesn’t even have to be anything bad, just that it offends someone who is Democrat and their life will come crumbling down around them in a blink of the eye thanks to the power of the mob.

---

2.) Your partner uses gas-lighting to maintain the upper hand in the relationship.


“Your partner declares reality for you, denying or distorting how things really are, in order to shore up a perception that supports how they see things. Common ways that this can show up is being told, ‘You’re not remembering correctly,’ ‘I never said that’ or ‘I never did that.’ They might infer that you’re not making sense or you’re faulty in the way you’re looking at things when you’re not. Because these responses can instill self-doubt over time, you’re more likely to go along with your partner’s distortions. In time, self-doubt creates a loss of trust in your perception and judgment, making you all the more vulnerable to a partner who wants to control you.” ― Carol A. Lambert, psychotherapist and author of Women with Controlling Partners 


We see everyday that Democrats changing history, spin facts in articles, or telling us how we should feel about ourselves when compared to others. Constantly trying to place us in a state of self-doubt with terms such as, “You didn’t build that” or “You were controlled by your partners” to make us feel inadequate in life, thus breaking us down so we are easier to control. 

---

3.) Your partner requires constant check-ins and wants to know where you are at and who you are with at all times.


“What can seem like genuine concern is often a way for an emotionally abusive person to be in total control when they are constantly keeping tabs on another person’s schedule. Texting a few times a day to ‘check in’ can turn into relentless harassment. Wanting an ongoing account of another person’s whereabouts, in addition to [a person] limiting where their partner goes or who they spend time with, are powerful examples of emotional abuse.” ― Lisa Ferentz, author of Treating Self-Destructive Behaviors in Trauma Survivors: A Clinician’s Guide 


They use the Media to alter what you view so you only see what they want you to see, controlling your view of the world in attempt shape your perception. Constantly we hear about Independent or Republicans being unfriend by people they are close too because they are the opposite party of Democrats which leads to a lot of broken relationships, thus limiting the number of people you can be social with over the course of your life.

4.) Your partner says hurtful things about you disguised as “Jokes.”


“Then when you complain, they claim they were only joking and you’re too sensitive. There is truth to the saying that behind every mean or sarcastic remark is a grain of truth.” ― Sharie Stines, therapist and relationship coach who specializes in recovery from abuse


Turn on the TV and you see comedians making very mean spirited jokes about people who voted for Donald J. Trump for president or People who are not voting for Democrats. You find yourself on the receiving end of the jokes that are designed to make you look stupid or a terrible person while elevating themselves above you. The comedians that do stand on your side are chased out of the industry or pushed to the point they have to retire.

---

5.) You find yourself apologizing even when you know you’ve done nothing wrong.


“Emotionally abused people often come to believe that they are stupid, inconsiderate or selfish because they have been accused of these things so often by their partner.” ― Beverly Engel, psychotherapist and author of The Emotionally Abusive Relationship


These past few years we seen legal gun owners shamed, white people told they are the root cause of all problems, Independents are the cause of Trump winning the election, and countless individuals having their lives destroyed for innocent remarks. Every single one of these people had Democrats demand apologies or is faced with the mob that they call upon when they have done nothing wrong by voicing their opinion.

---

6.) Your Partner refuses to acknowledge your strengths and belittles your accomplishments.


“Put-downs and degrading comments, which can be less obvious at the beginning, are not random attacks. Rather, they are intended to specifically target your strengths that seriously threaten your partner, who’s looking to have power and control in the relationship. The ways your partner reacts to your accomplishments or positive feelings about something can be telling. Does he show little interest or ignore you? Does he find something about what you’re saying to belittle? Does he change the topic to one that’s shaming in some way to you or criticize you about what you’re not doing? Over time, confronted with hurtful responses, your sense of confidence and trust in your own competence can slowly diminish.”  ― Lambert


We can see this playing out with Donald J. Trump and his supporters every day. Any accomplishments by Donald J. Trump are downplayed or spin in such a way that makes it looks like a failure. There is no compliments to be had, even on the days that are holidays where people come together to celebrate or mourn something that happen in our history. This even happens to people who are not Republicans, just which they have to be located in a state that is Red. Like in Florida, Texas, or any other state that has a natural disaster. You see people putting down the people from the state and even going as far as wishing that more of them to die.

----

These are 7 out of 11 traits that a mentally abusive partner will use; we see them everyday being displayed by Democrats towards Republican or Independents.  So when are they going to wake up and see how abusive they are towards an third of the nation? Never before has this nation been to the point where one side acts like this before. It is sickening to see day in and day out. So dear Democrats, you are that abusive partner and United States wants to file for divorce or you could become better and surprise us.
