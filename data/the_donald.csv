What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!",Nostradomas

331,A Lesson in History: The 4th of July and the True Date and Cost of Independence,37,c8r44f,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c8r44f/a_lesson_in_history_the_4th_of_july_and_the_true/,4,2019-07-03 20:43:54,"We celebrate the Fourth of July and it is also known as Independence Day. Many people are under the impression that we gained our independence from Great Britain on July 4th, but this actually not true. The Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, but it was not until after the American Revolution ended that we won our independence from Great Britain.

Since America was under the King‚Äôs rule in the very beginning they were known as colonies not as states. Once the Declaration of Independence was signed, America became known as the United States. The thirteen colonies that were involved in the American Revolution were: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These states were the thirteen original states in the United States.

In the beginning the colonies were pretty much allowed to develop on their own, but then suddenly in 1763 Britain decided to take a more active role in the colonies. By then it was too late because the colonies and Great Britain had major differences in their lifestyles and politics. After the French and Indian War was over in 1763 Great Britain decided to tax the colonies to help pay for the war and to help pay for the colonies‚Äô defense. Britain also decided to make the colonies return revenue to the mother country. Because of the strict guidelines that Britain was now trying to enforce, many colonists were left unhappy.

One of the main reasons that the colonists were unhappy was because Britain decided to tax the colonies excessively. Mostly on molasses and sugar. The colonies did not have any representation in Parliament. Some of the colonists, such as Samuel Adams, John Adams, and the Sons of Liberty felt that they should not have to pay taxes since they were not being represented.

But things didn‚Äôt stop there. After the problems with the first taxes, Britain continued to pass even more acts that were designed to make it hard for the colonies to be independent. Some of the more famous acts that were passed by King George III and Parliament were the Stamp Act, the Tea Act, and the Coercive Acts, which the Americans called the Intolerable Acts. All of these acts were designed to tax and/or control the American colonies.

One of the hardest jobs our founding fathers had was trying to convince other colonists that the colonies should be independent from Great Britain. Not everybody agreed to this, and Great Britain soon branded the colonists who wanted independence as rebels. It would be these rebels that would rally and fight to free themselves for a tyrannical government. 

The American Revolution began in 1775 with the ‚Äúshot heard round the world‚Äù which was fired at Lexington on April 19, 1775 and lasted eight and a half years. The American Revolution finally ended on September 3, 1783, with America and the King of England signing the Treaty of Paris.

So while we remember July 4th, 1776 as our day of independence, remember the sacrifice that was made to earn it. Almost 13,000 Americans were either wounded or killed fighting for what they believed. Another 20,000 were taken prisoner. 

It‚Äôs one thing to stamp your foot and say ‚ÄúWe declare independence!‚Äù  It‚Äôs quite another to go earn it. Remember that freedom is never free. God bless America and God bless you and your family as we remember the sacrifice that was made so that we can truly enjoy this beautiful country and the freedom God has given us.",Yarbzy

White people that go around beating up non-whites, and even beating up white people that try to defend non-whites.

This is literally the same tactics that KKK and Democrats used in the not-so-distant past.

Antifa = KKK = White supremacists

(incidentally, call Antifa white supremacists and they FLIP THE FUDGE OUT, it's kinda funny/scary to watch. They'll start calling you anti-semitic slurs, homophobic slurs, racial slurs, all kinds of slurs just to try to force you to call them ""communists"" or something less abrasive.

Clearly. I don‚Äôt really pay much to it though, and I brush it off and enjoy whatever football, basketball, etc game I‚Äôm watching.

However, the way Rapinoe has represented the country for the USWNT in the World Cup, whether it‚Äôs Trump bashing, virtue signaling, disrespecting anthem, or shitting on America in general, is downright disgusting. I can barely push past it because it makes me so cynical toward the team.

However, I don‚Äôt know if I can bring myself to cheer against the USWNT because of the actions of one asshole, especially since most of the women on the team want to represent their country respectfully and have worked hard to get there. There‚Äôs definitely a silver lining for me if the USWNT loses, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tasteful to cheer against the USWNT because of Rapinoe. Just want to provide some perspective. Supporting a US defeat because of someone we don‚Äôt like is similar (much smaller scale) to lefties supporting a bad economy or war with Iran because of someone they don‚Äôt like. In the end though, I think we can all agree Rapinoe can eat a shit sandwich and I hope she sits during the final if they defeat England.

EDIT: To avoid confusion, the point of my post is to contradict those I‚Äôve seen cheering against the team in order to see Rapinoe eat crow due to all the White House, Trump comments she‚Äôs made. Her rhetoric has made me cynical toward the team, but it would never trump my support for the team due to all the other players and what they represent.",FlyMarines45

Scott Adams has changed his view on Antifa after watching a ‚Äúrevealing‚Äù video from a former member who explained the reason he did it was because he was an angry young man who wanted to have ‚Äúfun‚Äù and act out his violent fantasies. Scott went on to say that the reason they target ‚ÄúNeo Nazis‚Äù is because it‚Äôs the easiest arrest to explain away when challenged by those running background checks. I‚Äôm not sure why he found this so revelatory. History is replete with this behavior.

Young men joined Pol Pot, Mao, Che, Castro, Lenin, The Klan, and Hitler because they had a chance to enact violence and feel powerful. Ideology was secondary and only a mechanism by which they afforded themselves absolution for their violence, by attacking ‚Äúacceptable targets.‚Äù Even in the US military, there have been men who rushed to enlist at the first sign of conflict for similar reasons.

Nazis targeted ‚Äúoppressive‚Äù races. The communist movements targeted the ‚Äúexploitive‚Äù wealthy. Antifa targets ‚ÄúNeo-Nazis,‚Äù and that net gets cast wider every day, thanks to the MSM. 

Soros knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing as he funnels money to these groups. Angry, discontent, greedy bullies will use any excuse given to enact violence, whether ‚Äúreligious enlightenment,‚Äù a philosophy, a political movement, or a response to ‚Äúinjustice.‚Äù The cause is always secondary.

I had nothing against illegal immigrants having worked with them, they were hard workers and overall good people. At the same time, I felt that America shouldn't be expected to house everyone who comes here. Also our labor market can only handle so many unskilled workers.

That all changed when I watched the Dem debates. When they started speaking Spanish it dawned on me: they will not stop. They will not stop until your kids speak Spanish, until the cartels rule the streets, and half your paycheck is taken away for healthcare to people who weren't even born here. Their rhetoric has gone from mildly annoying to absolutely insane, calling deportation centers ""concentration camps"". They don't care about the long-term wellbeing of immigrants, they're just pandering to get illegal votes. 

I have nothing personally against illegals. They are usually good people. But we simply cannot sustain them all. Our labor market can't handle it and if there is to be healthcare reform, it certainly wouldn't be able to handle it. We also need to make sure they can speak at least a little English before they come here and the mere mention of such a policy will send a liberal into a temper-tantrum.

They are in for a surprise when they realize that the internet, might actually not be Representative of what most people really think.",sand313man

Why are the Democrats against cleaning up 31 false seats to benefit our elections? It's not like there are only 2 states that have over 31 seats and electoral votes. And it's not like the two states with the most non-citizens happen to be on the on the border of Mexico. 

I wonder if there is some kind of pattern? Maybe one were Democrats bring in illegals to inflate their population on a census that doesnt ask citizenship questions in order to boost their electoral college votes during presidential elections. Why else would California,the immigrant haven of America, have so many house reps? It all makes sense when they push to bring in migrants with little to no checks and allow them to live in sanctuary cities in their states. It makes sense when a simple question about citizenship can change the impact they have on elections. 

I hope Trump's question gets through because it will be the biggest change in American politics that this country has ever seen and Democrats would easily lose the election.",AnotherPSA

&#x200B;

Antifa brawled with the Trump Free Speech Rally people.  Cops stood by and did nothing.  The major media didn't cover it.

[https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/antifa-terrorists-armed-explosives-projectiles-arrested-portland-oregon-attempting-attack-trump-rally/](https://www.lawenforcementtoday.com/antifa-terrorists-armed-explosives-projectiles-arrested-portland-oregon-attempting-attack-trump-rally/)

&#x200B;

Antifa was empowered and started repeating it at other events across the country.  Defenders of free speech and the 2nd Amendment started attending these rallies to provide a safe space that the police refused to provide.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward 2 months, and it comes to a head, via a tragedy, in Charlottesville in August 2017.  When the media and police allow mob violence, you get mob violence that is bound to end in tragedy.

&#x200B;

Now two years later... June 2019.  It's happening again.  I pray it doesn't end in another tragedy, but if the police don't start protecting innocent people, and if the media doesn't cover violence by the left, it's bound to repeat.

One reason is commonly overlooked.  In the 1980's, a cult moved into Oregon.  This isn't a conspiracy theory.  This is a fact.

It was the Rajneesh Cult.  A guru from India that came to the US to escape prosecution there and other places.  A hippie, free love, con artist, snake oil type guy.  

This cult settled in Oregon and began running into issues with locals (justifiably).

The cult decided to try and fill all the local and state political offices with their members.

The way voting worked at that time in Oregon, there wasn't a residency type waiting period to vote.

So, the cult went out into US with buses and bus tickets.  They gave those tickets and bus trips to thousands of homeless people across the US.  They all arrived to their compound.  The cult was trying to stack the vote.

Eventually, they dumped nearly all of them in Portland.  *Thousands* of homeless and mentally unstable people.

Fast forward 40 years .... look at what's in Portland.

Obviously, this isn't the only reason.  Soros and Dems are creating this.  However, the insane foundation in Portland is a perfect breeding ground for it.

Edit. Beet juice or are those glow in the dark magic markers non toxic? They would be good UV light markers. I think if you pull the center of a marker out and soak it in water it will make the water glow in uv light.

Or if you put some on YOURSELF or your property so if they touched you it would be on them or what they hit you with


Ask your local police if that would be legal.

Exploding dye bag banks give to bank robbers do this. Also those clothing tags often have a marking dye in them.

Ask your local police. Laws are different everywhere.

If you do get a self defense spray get two and try to practice with on at home outside. That stuff will shoot far and clear out a room with harsh fumes so you should practice with one and keep the other.

If it is a visible stain that can be seen being made while the attacker is involved in an attack then the shape of that stain could be matched to the attacker. It would deanonymize all those people in their masks and hoodies.

Also if some gets some self defense spray with a harsh fumes on their mask they will be forced to remove that mask and expose their face to cameras.

Edit: just thinking out loud here but I remember now that some of those old Sony night vision video cameras could see through cloth. Might be able to get some faces that way or force them to wear such thick masks that they have to be very uncomfortable. Those sony old handy cams recorded for like 8 hours on one video tape in extended play mode if you have one lying around to test. They also had really good zoom lens so you could be far away and possibly record face through bandanas etc. Thrift stores often have these.

You can also remove the ir filter inside newer cameras if you know what you are doing and then cover the lens with some filters that let ONLY It light from the sun in. Then you get an ir picture in the camera. It can also see right through black plastic bags like they are cellophane.

Some new small wifi security cams have night modes and if you turn that one during the day they remove the ir filter inside and they might be able to see through a thin bandana on a face.  There are a few really cheap tiny security cams these days with night ir.  There is one that is like 20$ and can carry an SD card.",Aszaszasz

1302,I'm learning about karma donations. (media based),34,c892tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c892tf/im_learning_about_karma_donations_media_based/,18,2019-07-02 16:14:06,"First actual post here, be gentle.

Like a lot of people, i found this subreddit based on the quarantine. I saw a forward from grandma last night (im really only there for the wholesome forwards) about the media, and decided to try something.

the first part of what i said, ""Trump labeling any reporting he doesn't like as fake news is detrimental to free speech."" which it is. as awful as the media is there are a few times {citation needed} that his fake news claim is somewhat diversionary, which is not a good thing. dont get me wrong, calling out fake news for being fake news is good, and should keep the media in check (even though it doesn't). anyway, as predicted, no one has an issue with this statement.

I went on to say how the left leaning media discrediting any conservative journalism (on the basis of being conservative) is not good for journalism, and how ""news"" being biased in any direction is bad for informing voters/citizens. As you can imagine, this is where people flipped the hell out. how dare i call most media left-leaning, and would i rather it was all nazi's deserve free speech, yadayadayada. people seem to forget the difference between op-eds and news. op-eds are supposed to be biased, news is not, and people forget that, and im seeing that most people think their views, wherever they fall, are just about center.",eltaquito

##Primary North Carolina District 3, July 9th, 2019! 



[**Joan Perry!**](http://archive.is/meKce) vs [**Gregory Murphy!**](http://archive.is/XSCjE)



>>*During a special primary election held on April 30 to fill the seat left vacant following the death of Walter B. Jones, Jr., no candidate in the Republican field received more than 30 percent of the vote, leading to the July 9 runoff. Republicans Greg Murphy and Joan Perry will face off for a spot as the Republican candidate in the general election, which will be held September 10.
In the April primary, Murphy received 22.54 percent of the votes cast for Republican candidates (9,505), while Perry garnered 15.44 percent (6,510).*



>>*In a press release, Murphy, who served five years in the N.C. Legislature, said he was humbled by the election results.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked hard my entire life to meet goals and this was just another example. However, just like so many things in my life, there were so many others working alongside me that made the goal achievable.‚Äù
Perry said she was ‚Äúvery pleased‚Äù with the April primary results.
‚ÄúWe recognize that our support was district-wide. I really felt like my message was resonating with voters and that was both encouraging and humbling to me,‚Äù she commented.*



>>*Perry said she would focus on Hurricane Florence recovery as well as immigration and infrastructure issues if elected to the District 3 House seat.‚ÄúThose are things we‚Äôll continue to focus on as we move forward,‚Äù she said.
The special election featured seventeen Republican candidates, six Democrats and two Libertarians competing for nominations. The winner of the July 9 runoff will face Democrat Allen Thomas, former executive director of Kinston‚Äôs N.C. Global TransPark Authority, and Libertarian Tim Harris.*


>>*One stop early voting for the July 9 runoff ends Friday, July 5, at 7 p.m. The last day to return an absentee by mail ballot is Tuesday, July 9. On election day polls will open at 6:30 a.m. and close at 7:30 p.m.
For more information, contact the Craven County Board of Elections at 252-636-6600 or visit their website,*

Prediction: President Trump Gets Nomination by the end of March 10th Primaries with around 1,300 to 1,500 delegates. If accurate that means President Trump has 23 weeks (165 days) to essentially campaign for the general while Democrats continue the primaries well into to the summer.

The Chairman has to play the game for his people so the old guard doesn't whack the guy.   
The other side is that if Chairman Un does come from behind the curtain and frees NK, adapts capitalism and turns his country around, he will be worshipped much more than his grandfather was.

1695,My 2 cents about abortions and banning abortions.,9,c86er7,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c86er7/my_2_cents_about_abortions_and_banning_abortions/,26,2019-07-02 10:46:21,"I am pro-life, but in my view banning abortions would be a bad idea.

It wouldn't stop the abortions as much (maybe reduce the number), but it would force some women, who really don't want to have children, to use some illegal and dangerous methods, that can get both the mother and the child dead.

It is a tough choise, without banning abortions women will be killing fetuses, but with the ban they will be terminating pregnancy a bit less often, but it will also quite often lead to their own death, making it 2 for 1. 

So, banning the abortions might lead to 1.5x or 1.25x increase in the death rate, which isn't what we want.

That was just a personal observative opinion. Write in the comments whether you agree or disagree and why.",SocialSushiEater

A lot of things have been positive (but of course the media doesn't report on that accurately.)

I'm aware of the scare tactics/straight up lies the media spouts. What's going on with those tweets, with congressmen reporting back that it's essentially concentration camp status? People crammed together, put into cages outside and babies pretty much starved. I'm wondering if this is all some fiction story she wrote?

I mean, have we reached full lying status where they are literally trying to paint him as Hitler putting people into concentration camps? People are believing this stuff 100% and I'm sure none of us would actually want that to be the truth. There has to be some proof against it?

I was Bernie or Bust. I still hate the Democratic party with a fiery passion. I can't say I'm for Bernie 2020 as he caved in and his supporters raised more hell about the election rigging than he ever did. (Can I just say how proud I am of the rioting outside the convention last cycle...? Okay I'm done now.) Anyways that's my main concern, is what's happening at the border.

Just how large is their radical base, really? Do they have a gathering place that rivals r/The_Donald ?

The passion we share for this great man is so beautiful and I believe it is the true cause of the lefty tears and tantrums.

They are jealous of the way that Trump connects to us on such a human, honest, loyal and trustworthy way. Trump is probably one of the best Presidents ever at working at or immediately delivering on the promises he campaigned on. Trump isn't just virtue signalling and empty word salads, he speaks to our souls.

In time the emotion around him will be lost in the stream of time and the ONLY thing that will be left is a list of things he did and did not do. How people felt will be a side note or addendum, if mentioned at all.

Barrack Obama will get a mention as the first Black President and may even get a mention as the President on watch when Osama was captured. Further mention of his efforts will be an excoriation.

Trump will come across very well in the fullness of time. Maybe your children's time and definately in your grandchildren's time",Gamergating

We do this without thinking because it is common courtesy.
We are all in this together. You will never know anything other than that when you hold a door, because it doesn‚Äôt matter.

&#x200B;

Wow. What a week, am I right?  


\-Prominent (de facto speaker of the house) congresswoman stages heartbreaking photos of herself and her comrades in front of a parking lot, in hopes to show that she is, in fact, human when it comes to the horrors of caged children and starving families at the border.

&#x200B;

\- The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, halted attacks on Iranian facilities for fear of exacerbating tense situations and the unnecessary loss of life - to which the leftist media claimed the president was ""backing down.""

&#x200B;

\-The democrats shamed themselves on stage in front of millions of American citizens; more or less chanting the virtues of socialism, fascism, and totalitarianism; all the while offering nothing of value to their own political ideas.

&#x200B;

\- The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, announced great progress in the ongoing trade wars with China; that they would be purchasing billions of dollars worth of American production, and that no new tariffs would be enacted for now -  to which the leftist media declared ""China won the trade war.""

&#x200B;

\- Watch dog group Project Veritas is, once again, demonized and censored for revealing the truth about leftist-globalist affiliates who admitted to planning to actively work against the president in the 2020 campaign - to which they deny - yet it's all there.

&#x200B;

\- Prominent subreddit, T\_D is quarantined under extremely out-of-context and very trivial allegations (from a known liar) of violence against police officers - a sect of our wonderful country, whom has been praised and supported since T\_D's founding. - to which the patriots of reddit revolt; creating what is, perhaps one of the most powerful, uniting, America-loving show of force since reddit's inception. 

&#x200B;

\- The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump walks across the S/N Korean border, balls in hand, in a show of peace, with Leader Kim Jung Un; the first sitting president to step foot in enemy territory such as this, leaving his secret service behind.

This subreddit become the one place that I wanted to call my online home.

I have always leaned right, and can say that the left's increasing vitriol these last 3 years has done nothing but push me further right on the spectrum. Back in 2016 I voted for our beloved president, but I didn't think he was the best candidate ever... I worried that he wouldn't act on his promises... that maybe he was just a good showman and actor... 

I was wrong. He is the best president of my lifetime by a longshot. MAGA 2020.

This is the one handout they will never support, as it erodes their stupid talking point that voter ID laws are ""racist"" and a ""poll tax.""

&#x200B;

In the minds of the Democrats, poor Black and Hispanic people are too poor and/or too stupid to 1) buy their own passport, state ID, or driver license like 99% of the population, 2) be able to buy alcohol or cigarettes, 3) own, rent, or drive a car, 4) get a job, 5) get a loan from a bank, 6) open a bank account, 7) pick up a prescription, 8) get food stamps, 9) go on other forms of welfare, 10) apply for Medicaid or SS, 11) apply for unemployment benefits, 12) get on an airplane or go through TSA security, 13) get married, 14) buy a gun, 15) adopt a pet from a shelter, 16) get a hotel/motel room ,17) hunt or fish, 18) buy a cell phone, 19) gamble, 20) donate blood, 21) buy an M-rated video game, 22) buy nail polish, or 23) purchase NyQuil or Sudafed.

&#x200B;

That is a LAUNDRY LIST of stuff you need an ID for, and it's mind boggling to think you can survive in the 21st century without government-issued photo ID. Everyone has an ID, but the left still refuses to require it for something as important and crucial to our sovereignty as voting. They will offer free healthcare, free college, free student loan forgiveness, free healthcare FOR ILLEGALS, but free photo IDs for citizens to enable voter ID laws? An actually acceptable use of taxpayer money? Nah!",WeaverFan420

Many of you have asked us about making donations to Ravelry. Thank you so much for thinking of this, but the best way to support us is by supporting Ravelry designers, dyers, advertisers, and shops, particularly those run by people who are black, indigenous, people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, disabled crafters, those who belong to otherwise marginalized communities, and those who are speaking out on justice and equality issues to effect change. If you are specifically moved to donate, rather than making a donation to us we would like to suggest contributing to RAICES Texas, or finding an organization local to you that is doing anti-racism work or meeting the needs of the LGBTQ+ members of your community or other marginalized groups.
New Features and Policies

>For over 10 years, we've had a hate speech policy on Ravelry, and our No Trump Support policy is an extension of that. Our definition of hate speech is as follows: Hate Speech and Hateful Imagery Words, phrases, or images deemed by Ravelry's owners to express, either deliberately or unknowingly, hatred or contempt towards a group of people, based on areas such as their ethnic, cultural, religious or sexual identity, gender, socio-economic class, or with reference to physical health or mental health, are not allowed.
Everyone on Ravelry's staff is committed to continually improving our site and making our community safer. We all realize this is an ongoing process and we have work to do.
In January, we created all new tools to make sure that we 1) can easily organize and handle the things that are reported to us and 2) notice repeat offenders and take action. We previously managed all of that with email, and this is a big improvement, but not enough. We have now decided to stop hosting groups with moderators who harbor or disregard users who repeatedly violate our community guidelines. We are starting by closing existing groups that have historically had repeat violations of those guidelines.
If you see a profile, pattern, or forum post that violates our guidelines, you can anonymously flag it to report it to Ravelry staff. We will continue improving our reporting features and our behind-the-scenes systems for handling problems.
Some Ravelers have shared with us that marginalized people felt unsafe because groups with a history of hate speech violations were allowed to remain on the site. To you, we would like to say that we're sorry, and you will see us continue to improve Ravelry's safety.
Moving Forward Together

>This year, the greater fiber community has been having long-overdue conversations about diversity, racism, homophobia, size inclusion, disability awareness, and equity.
We want to recognize - and join in on - the praise we've seen for the BIPOC, LGBTQ+, disabled, and body-positive members of Ravelry who have been speaking out and making a positive difference. We are grateful for your labor, knowledge, willingness to share your lived experiences, and courage to demand changes to our site, the fiber community's culture, and the world at large. Please know that we appreciate and thank you for your work!
We would be grateful if all Ravelers would join us in making our community more safe, just, and fun; especially if you identify as an ally, please help make our community safer for our fellow Ravelers who are part of marginalized groups. Above all else, please continue to enjoy Ravelry, connect with other Ravelers, and celebrate your love of yarn! We have so many great things planned for our future and we're excited to share them with you.",MAGA_Lady_MAGA

Recently there has been a ton of discussion about how platforms are censoring conservative voices and are removing unpopular opinions and content. I see people hoping a new platform comes around for conservative voices, but this will not fix the issue. Nor will it hurt the platforms that have been hurting us for so long.


**Advertisers.** All of this crap comes down to advertisers. We need to go after them and publicly shame them for advertising on platforms that ALLOW calls of violence, with refusals to remove them. We need to do exactly what the leftists are doing, but better.


All of these posts on other subreddits calling for the murder of our sitting president or other public figures?


Submit screenshots to the brand. Ask them: ""Do you endorse these views? Is this what your brand is about?"" Get them to remove advertisements from the very platform that say WE are the bad ones.


We can do the same for Youtube. Facebook. Twitter. **We need to go after the advertisers.** We get stuck in a circlejerk of being pissed off at specific people and complain. Cut the funding to these sites off at the legs. Let them know that our voice matters too. Or else they will crash and burn with no revenue.",Basilman121

Absolutely zero regrets, I love my potus.  

My family however has mild to moderate tds and is in denial about dems, they get their news from cnn and such so that‚Äôs not too helpful.  It doesn‚Äôt help everyone in my family and my only and best friend are libs.  They thankfully don‚Äôt disown me but I get a shitload of eye rolls and disappointed energy from them.  How do you guys cope lol, I‚Äôve got y‚Äôall but it‚Äôs sad to not be on the same page with the whole family?


Not important to my question per se but more info, don‚Äôt care if you read or not:

Also, I just last night asked my dad what he thinks of the democrat noms ALL being for free health care for illegals and wanting less border security, he didn‚Äôt believe me so I linked him a Tim pool video since I figured it was a good bridge.  He was too busy to watch and said the dems were wanting ‚Äúfree BASIC healthcare to not be inhumane‚Äù and the republicans don‚Äôt like for the most part social programs like paid healthcare, which I‚Äôm on momentarily for an ocd relapse and not able to work but I‚Äôm getting better and will be back to work soon, he loves to mention that bit a lot lol.  He then said that a lot of ‚Äúalt right‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunists pretending to be Americans‚Äù are pushing fake news and that there is a fake news problem but it‚Äôs mostly them and the president (wtf kek?).  Final bit of info he had for me was ‚Äúlook at what Trump has paid in taxes the last 20 years versus what you have...he‚Äôs made millions more than you and believe it or not but you‚Äôve paid more than he has.‚Äù  Jesus Christ it‚Äôs maddening how bad they hate him.  I don‚Äôt know a whole lot about the trump tax issue or what he‚Äôs paid in 20 years but what politician isn‚Äôt sleezeball?  Even if it was true I still see Trump as a lesser of two evils, the dems a nuts.  

Sorry for the rant at the end, I just have no one to talk to except you guys and it sucks when your family thinks you‚Äôre drinking the punch.  My heart goes out to the pedes here who‚Äôve actually lost family to tds and I‚Äôm thankful that hasn‚Äôt happened to me.  Thanks for anyone who reads and sorry for format it‚Äôs on mobile.

So... this is a bit of a request, I know, but this needs to be things that are difficult to argue against.  If I link anything from Breitbart, they'll likely not click and just dismiss it as ""propaganda"" or similar BS.  I don't want them to have any excuses here.  So I need places that are either more center-leaning, or are at least not further left than Fox.

The more pictures and videos involved, the better.  I want to shove this in their face so they can't deny it.  For simplicity's sake, let's keep this list contained to no sooner than when Donald Trump won the Republican Nominee.

You guys are one of the most welcoming communities. 

I originally started of as someone who was ""anti trump"" but as I looked more and more into Trump and his policies, I started realizing how wrong I was. How the media lied. How my peers didn't understand his policies. 

When it was down to Trump and Hillary, I thought Trump was the ""lesser of two evils""

But when he started getting things done, I realized that he wasn't evil. He was a man with common sense in a world of idiots. 

When I saw that he was meeting with Russia, and with North Korea, my mind was ""HOLY SHIT"" because he has the balls to do things right. 

I got in reddit late 2018, and I heard a lot about you. How you were bad and whatnot. 

I was lazy, but one day when I was browsing AHS (now banned, had some cheap laughs for their reasoning) I decided to look at this subreddit.

Holy shit was everyone wrong. You guys were welcoming. Compared to the dems, who see me as a vote and nothing more, everyone here saw me as a human. 

I saw how everything was twisted into the democratic narrative, and more. 

How everyone complains about how the US took over the US. I personally saw it as an ok move. Once again, coming from a native. 

Now with the concentration camps from ms failure, as someone with relatives who went to Auschwitz and going to the holocaust museum myself and seeing the footage, I realized that that could be the future for people dissenting from a left wing opinion. 

And with antifa and their violent assaults, made me look here and realize no such thing happened but by those who are so far right they arent even trump supporters but nazis.

And seeing how he was going to tackle immigration made me happy. This was amplified when I learned of Mollie Tibbets, with the illegals case being held in my city.

When we finish the immigrant problem, then I truly believe our country will improve tenfold.",Imperialdude94

This has been a very successful tactic by the left, using Federal judges on State level to issue bans and injunctions to POTUS/Fed.

Every single policy in CA should be slammed by County judge bans and injunctions - ballot harvesting, gas tax, benefits and licenses for illegals, sanctuary policy etc etc etc.

I've only heard ift happen maybe a handful of times, and to very little effect.

Is it just the cost?  Why is this not used as a tactic more against these out of control State governments?

If it's really stubborn, try cold booting both the phone and the PC/laptop first and *then* trying this.

It looks like maybe app updates are throwing it off, so you may have to repeat first the cold boot and then these instructions from time to time.

1) To get into The_Donald on your phone: Start with a desktop/laptop computer - not your phone.

2) Pull up DuckDuckGo. (Goolag is apparently hiding The_Donald.)

3) Search on The_Donald.

4) Look for the Reddit site in the results and click through. Using ""old.reddit"" may work better than using the new reddit.

5) Click ""Continue"" after the dire warning that you will die if you read the site lol.

It's still there, just in a stripped-down version. 

Users are saying that once you do the above, you can get in on your mobile anytime you want (except for possible problems with app updates, and in that case just repeat the above) so it's worth a try.

Please pass this along to anyone having trouble getting in.",poorly_educated_13

And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, ‚ÄúHe is out of his mind.‚Äù 

And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, ‚ÄúHe is possessed by Beelzebul,‚Äù and ‚Äúby the prince of demons he casts out the demons.‚Äù 

And he called them to him and said to them in parables, ‚ÄúHow can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. But no one can enter a strong man‚Äôs house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house. 

‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin‚Äù‚Äî for they were saying, ‚ÄúHe has an unclean spirit.‚Äù",RedPilledPreacher

That is as slate says sad.Oh and here's something even [sadder](https://youtu.be/tsncv_vYFHc).

8) [**Tulsi Gabbard**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) : [Her shining moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6d9-kn3U3o). She dun messed up when they asked her about equal pay. As we all know thattopic is a fucking myth. Tulsi could've called them out on it but she decided to play safe and decided totalk about her military history, not a move that went down well with some people. Her open bordersand minimum wage policies were also not a good move.

9) [**Kirsten Gillibrand**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Gillibrand) : Her number one policy is to make sure Roe v Wade is not threatened by the Ultra chad states (Youknow who I'm talking about), at a time where people are living from paycheck to paycheck,infrastructure is going to shit and America is being invaded full on by people who want to rip thesystem off, her greatest concern is to make sure that babies can be routinely murdered noquestions asked. Hillary played the woman card last time and failed this bitch is trying to do thesame and will fail even more spectacularly.

10) [**Kamala Harris**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris) : ***America doesn't want to witness a food fight. They want to witness how we are gonna put food onthe table.***

Me: ?????????? The fuck is this cunt talking about ? What about [that time ?](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-2020-democratic-candidates-new-hampshire-town-hall-20190422-story.html)

[Let us not forget the time she advocated jailing parents if their children went truant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml3C03VxJL8)

Unfortunately I have a bad feeling that she's going to end up the nominee.

11) [**John Hickenlooper**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hickenlooper) : Only thing he said that makes sense **socialism is not the solution**.

12) [**Jay Inslee**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Inslee) : He cares about climate change nothing else.

13) [**Amy Klobuchar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar) **:** All she did was interrupt Inslee\*\*.\*\*

14) [**Beto O'Rourke**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beto_O%27Rourke) : Needless to say this fool only received any attention at all thanks to his shameless pandering.

15) [**Tim Ryan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ryan_(Ohio_politician)) : This peep thinks that the Taliban committed 9/11. Why is this guy still in politics ?

16) [**Bernie Sanders**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders) : Moderator :Senator sanders what do we need to do about the immigration crisis ?

Bernie: Let us be very clear WE NEED SOMEONE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE BIG CORPORATIONS!!

Bernie has lost his flame and he is now officially classified as a shill.

17) [**Elizabeth Warren**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren) : Nothing about her stands out to me. Boring and boring.

18) [**Marianne Williamson**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Williamson) : Apparently she want's to beat Trump using love...... Didn't know we had a hippy running for2020. She has a good point about chronic illnesses though.

19) [**Andrew Yang**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang) : They cut his mic off. The DNC is rigged and that's all I'm going to say.

20)  [**Eric Swalwell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Swalwell) :  Proposes a mandatory buyback of ""military style semi-automatic assault weapons,"" with prosecutionfor anyone who fails to comply after the allotted timeline. Yeaaaah that's a bad idea.

&#x200B;

I wandered away from this beloved community.  There I saw a post decrying the racism/sexism/whatever ism of our country and blaming it on POTUS.  All based on BS and TDS.  

I made the mistake of pointing out Obama set up the detention centers on the border, that Congress passed the laws, that Ralph ""coonman"" Northam wore blackface, etc.

No replies.  No counter argument.  Just downvoted into strong negative territory.  

Here, it's not about your feelings, but about the truth and the facts.  Shitpost if you want, but we call out the fake news and bull shit for what it is.

So, admittidly, im a bit off on current events because ive been doing some major renovations that have taken away from my time of keeping in the know. Its came to my attention, through the biased reporting of NPR, that trump has come to some ""pause"" in escallation of the trade war, including but not limited to, the inclusion of huawai back into the technological fray, wheras china would then begin to rebuy product from our farmers. I was loving the hard line approach to chinas eggregious behavior regarding trade, and this seems like a roll back of this approach at little to no gain...it seems that we are back to square 1. Is this simply in name of getting shit done in the long term - a relative lull to formulate a more concrete solution? Is there something im missing? I obviously took what NPR was saying with a grain of salt, so im wondering what exactly you guys are thinking or know regarding this matter. This is in no way or shape concern trolling, im simply looking for what was most likley brazenly left out of the ""reporting"" i heard.",Num_Pwam_Kitchen

Then, they are going to gain a supermajority in the electoral college after the 2020 census, thanks to the millions of illegal aliens they are importing every year.  After that, this country becomes a one-party political system.

Certain organizations with subreddits recruit mentally ill and depressed people to fight viciously for their hypocritical ideologies. I saw a post, where someone looking to start an Antifa chapter admitted to having severe depression and illness, and was encouraged on this front.

I suffer from depression, it's just the way I am and I'm not sure if it's inherent in my biological makeup or a result of living in a twisted society. But I'd like to say to everyone here who may be down in the dumps, everyone who struggles with mental health issues, everyone who feels like they lack direction:

You are loved. You are wonderful. You have the spark of divinity within you. 

You may feel alone and maybe you feel like you're a moment away from throwing up your hands and exacting revenge on those you feel wronged you and wronged society, but that's precisely what these vampiric organizations feed on. They perpetuate themselves through manipulation of emotion, devoid of internal logic and reason.

Ultimately, we here at The_Donald are a community of love, strength, respect and kindness. We joke, we tease and we attack the ideology of hate merchants, but at the core of our being, we are a family. We are the wall. We are the vanguard of justice.

Always stand true. Always help your fellow centipedes when they need help getting back on their own 100 feet. Never forget that it's the environment that's sick, and we have to exemplify our values through action.

Here you are loved. And that's what terrifies the darkness the most.

Stay comfy, and may the blessings of the Father light your way.",MisterUniverse1

I thought it was interesting since this book, [Bart Croughs - In the name of the Woman, the Gay and the Alien](http://www.euronet.nl/users/bc/boek/solli.html#de%20wetten), was written in 1995 and shows once again this phenomenon is deeprooted in the West. His examples are of the Netherlands and can easily be transplanted into every Western country. Bart Croughs is a Dutch libertarian columnist.

&#x200B;

**First Law**: in the case of West vs. non-West the progressive chooses the side of non-West. (Such as colonialism, Crusades, the idea of English being the first language, etc.)

**Second Law**: in the case of minority vs. majority the progressive chooses the side of the minority. (Such as gays, immigrants, muslims in Europe, non-cis, etc. Women, although majority, are considered a minority also)

**Third Law**: in the case of minority vs. non-West, the progressive is conflicted. (Gays vs. muslims, inter-ethnic migrant clashes, Israel's Palestinian troubles, white feminists vs. PoC feminists, SWPLs beat up by minorities, etc.)",It_could_be_better

It's already on the radar of law enforcement and it's already got some media coverage. The Bureau and DHS were informed of these credible threats, and there is a local task force that Arlington and Fairfax are involved in as well that deals with domestic terror. Portland PD may have been told to ""not intervene,"" or whatever it was that coward Wheeler directed them to do or not do, but these task forces around DC tend not to screw around and there are many birdies whispering in lots of ears around this place at every hour of any given day...

I like to play competitive video games for the most part. I dont have time like I used to and was thinking back on it and a thought occurred...

When using the terminology I was used to, if life were a game, at this point in the match I would be calling Leftists, or Democrats, or Socialists (however they chose to self identify or label themselves) filthy casuals... The type of people who go into ranked matches ""just for fun"" and ruin the efforts of those giving a damn...

It's like they are playing in hardcore mode (permadeath) and are just constantly complaining its too hard, instead of playing the game... 

The good thing though, is that it seems there are far more of us actually playing life and enjoying it... The non-casuals outnumber the casuals lol

We are all enjoying ourselves while they are bitching in general chat... They respond to each other and post on the message boards while we just sit back, play, and enjoy ourselves... 

Then they bitch after elections because we voted and got our people in... ""why were the polls and numbers wrong""... It's because we weren't bitching and moaning about it... We are playing the game, getting our achievements, and watching the scrubs lose their shit...

I don't thing we have to worry about the media or the Dems... We are gonna keep on moving forward while they sit in their own shit and stew about it...

Silicon Valley, being the authoritarians that they are, think they can ban the opposition.

Word up motherfuckers - it‚Äôs the 20th century and the internet prevents you from burning books assholes - you can‚Äôt stop people from talking: you will forever fail losers.  Admire China more...

Genocides happen because of people like you.  Collectivists.

You are the people that were brownshirts in the days of hitler.  Low self- esteem impressionables that justify evil actions for the ‚Äúcause‚Äù (looking at you pantifa wannabes).

/Rant over.  May their evils see the light of day for the people can determine democratically the outcome.

Obligatory - violence is only for leftists, leave the pitchforks at home.  Gavrilo Princip - spark of WW1, the peace of which predicated WW2: collectivists: millions died for bullshit.

In accounting there is the fraud triangle, one of which‚Äôs aspects includes rationalization: what is more of a pussy rationalization than you committed evil on behalf of someone else - you literally admit it is bad, but sleep at night because it wasn‚Äôt really you that was bad - your the victim....  you did it because of other people (keep telling yourself that).

The right wins when people think for themselves and are provided information, no force needed.  Our path to victory is paved with the dissemination of information.  1984 is the manual for collectivists, not a warning.

Closing: Abortion is murder, censorship is fascism/communism (same fucking thing), global warming is political marketing, abuse of healthcare by your poor life choices is not a human right, and how many people need to die before you realize socialism is evil - 100 million ain‚Äôt enough for your blood thirsty ass?

SJW Identity politics and revisionism rampant.,31,c7mpzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c7mpzy/just_a_warning_but_designated_survivors_is_a_sjws/,5,2019-07-01 05:05:46,"No 9/11 didn't happen because of muslims, they were extremists. * Actual dramatic point...

Let's be real they were islamists aka Muslims aka Muslim extremists but the show compares law abiding Muslims with terrorists and makes them synonymous.

Does anyone still remember seeing the videos of muslims in AMERICA celebrating as the towers burned??? 

I tried to see if it wasn't complete indoctrination but sjw propaganda is ingrained into the writing and it's design to insert fear of anyone not liberal progressive as the bad guys. That do bad things based on purely identity. 

While citing the Constitution.. WTF

Key. Not all Muslims are terrorists buy all Islamic terrorists are Muslims. 

Also you'd think Pulse and San Bernardino would make folks realize that you could be a 2nd generation American born as into a Muslim household and become radicalized and go Aloha Snackbar on some Innocents. 

Yet SJWs and the GOP Establishment isn't solving this nor taking Sharia head-on and outlawing it",Deathstalker1776

So why do we need to know what race someone is on the census? So many people that say Hispanic are basically white unless they or their parents were born in a Latin American country. And many other people are Elizabeth Warren multi racial so the question is meaningless for them too. At the end of the day, we're all Americans, or we aren't and additional information is just data for sociologists to fap to. I also think that the media uses race to try to pressure people to vote for Democrats ie constantly repeating ""90% of blacks voted for Democrats/Hillary"". It doesn't matter, it's just used to divide Americans/help Democrats, and it's preventing the citizenship question from being added to the 2020 census so why not remove the question about race? I'd love to see Democrats try to explain how asking about citizenship is racist if race data isn't being gathered lol. Thanks for reading my post.",johnmic07

Once it's banned, pedes will be trying to figure out where to go. 

&#x200B;

This is my suggestion to try to stay somewhat connected:

Create a fairly simple website for the sole purpose of updating anyone doing a DDG search for ""The\_Donald"" about some of the temporary alternatives, and if/when there will be a permanent alternative built.

If it could be created soon, we could all start visiting it as soon as it is up and get it to the first DDG page when searching for ""The\_Donald"".

With regular visits from pedes searching for where to go next, it could remain on the first DDG page until our alternative is found/built. 

(If we could get that much traffic, maybe it could even be funded through small advertisements)

&#x200B;

Although I've paid attention to The\_Donald, I've never actually posted/joined before. I'm a self-proclaimed environmentalist. I also happen to be gay AKA the 2020 democrats' wet dream. I was 20 years old in 2016 when I voted for Trump. I was reluctant to do so because I was getting my news from limited sources (Facebook mainly). A few of my friends who paid more attention that I did told me that essentially, if I was to vote for Hillary, I'd be voting for World War 3. They assured me that he was going to win. It was hard to believe them considering the endless amount of negative coverage of Trump.

&#x200B;

I wasn't a full fledged Trump supporter during his first 2 years. I was still in school so, I continued to be bombarded with negativity about him. As recently as the government shutdown, I still wasn't sure if Trump was doing the right thing all of the time. It was probably the Mueller Fiasco that truly opened my eyes as to how skewed the public narrative is about Trump.

As someone who cares deeply about being a steward of the land, it's nearly impossible to avoid the climate change hysteria. Politicians, among others, talk endlessly about how nothing is being done, Trump wants to profit off Big Oil, yada yada yada. This is incredibly frustrating to me because I personally know of so many initiatives that encourage being a good steward of the land both locally and globally. These politicians are doing no favors for themselves. When they talk like this, it shits on the work that these initiatives are striving to achieve. I refuse to accept the whining, mob attitude. It's pretty safe to say that I am in full support of Trump as of now.

&#x200B;

This post was more of me ranting than making an actual point. I just wanted to show my support. I'm thankful for everyone here who refuses to be silenced/buy into the mob mentality. I am more than happy to support Trump again in 2020.",Chadromance

I am your typical reddit lurker. IRL I am a young male , libertarian and slightly right of center. Back in 2016 I would view many different political outlets, r/the_donald included. I was never too fond of this sub as it is/was mainly filled with cliche sh*tposts, but i kept viewing as an outsider knowing that there would be important information/news that would rise to the front page. 

Now that 2020 is around the corner, I have tried to view this sub as I do with all others and found that it was practically IMPOSSIBLE to view this subreddit on the mobile app. The subreddit was erased from reddit‚Äôs search engine. I went on to my web browser and googled ‚Äúreddit the donald‚Äù and the link was not showing up even though this site gets plenty of traffic. I had to enter in the full url to find it. 

The fact is, is that Silicon Valley (Reddit, google, twitter) has gone full 1984 after the veritas video was released. It sparked the fight for 2020  and now the race is finally in season. Reddit knows just how much this subreddit has helped Trump gain new followers, so of course it was right on time with quarantining the sub and unlisting it from search engines. 

I dont doubt that there could have been some radical righties threatening the Oregon police in the comments here. But i also dont doubt that shills could have easily sabotaged the subreddit giving admins an excuse to quarantine it. 

Even so, a few bad apples should not be the reason for quarantining a whole subreddit. Just look at BPT, CTH, or Politics...",Regulus-da-Tuscany

Let me begin with, I voted for Barrack Obama back in 2008. I was young and stupid and thought it was cool a minority would be president.

This was when the recession hadn't been felt.

I was a young student in college, when Obummer announced he was cutting financial aid and that a lot of people were going to have to take out student loans (funny how a lot of these hardcore leftist conveniently forgot that is something BIG that got them into debt). 

Okay. Whatever I thought. But then I noticed this huge rise in propaganda in 2012. Like HUGE. And I thought to myself, somethings not right. STEM propaganda, when, nobody wanted to hire engineers, just the cheap H1B's and other visas. This whole equality and homosexuality propaganda. Like, come on man. That stuff is legit evil and wrong it says so in the bible but all these idiots fail to see it.

I just got a new job at this time. About 50% or more of the people were there on a work visa from another country. They even had the lady who organized files on a hard drive on a work visa from another country, when my mom had just got laid off and nobody would hire her. And she is a U.S. citizen.

The H1B's were mostly all from Asian countries and they were more racist towards Hispanics than the few white people there ""You ever heard of a Mexican doing this job? Bahahahaha""

Yeah.

Later on I got laid off while the H1B's got to keep their jobs...

I remember this conspiracy about white educated men getting attacked through media and other. But I think it encompasses any educated man of working age, regardless of ethnicity.

Then the 2016 elections were coming up. I didn't really care who was running (Trump hadn't said he was running yet) as long as Obama was out. That's all I cared about. 

Then Obama said he was going to endorse Hillary for president
‚Ä¶

No. Just no. This can not be happening. I did not want to go through another 8 years of pretty much an Obama replacement, while they put on pedestals people from other countries while they bent over and fucked the American people (not all white by the way). They promoted STEM when all they wanted was cheap labor and outsourcing. No.

Then Trump said he was running. And he ACTUALLY MENTIONED THE ECONOMY AND THE JOB SITUATION AND THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS WERE BULLSHIT. Yes! The type of president we need. But no can't tell anyone or i'll get jumped and shunned by my family and friends. So I stayed quiet. But I would mention things that were obviously true and some people suspected it...

Then Trump mentioned Illegals. Noooooo. He would never get elected the Democrats would jump all over that and make everyone hate him. Fuck. He fucked up I thought. My hopes of an Obama replacement not making it into the white house diminished...

Fast forward to election night. I went out election day pissed form the racist H1B's. Pissed about the economy. And I stamped a hole next to Donald J. Trump. I couldn't have been the only Hispanic to do so because the staff at the poll locations had the facial expression of ""omg another one voted for Trump"" while the city mayor was looking at the ground in shock (the city mayor was there helping with the polling). 

Trump made it. Yes he did. I had a fat ass grin on my face. Turned off the television, and I went to sleep.

Also I don't believe climate change is man caused. I think it's supposed to happen.

5786,Immigration: Blueprint to turning green haired feminists over to the dark side in 15 min.,16,c7j4aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c7j4aq/immigration_blueprint_to_turning_green_haired/,6,2019-06-30 23:26:22,"**Immigration: pros v cons**

I live in Europe and have turned many people over the years using this simple logic. Perhaps European lefties are not as thick and violent as American ones. Either way, if you can trap one for a few minutes, give this a shot. Works every time for me. 

&#x200B;

**Valid arguments for continued mass immigration:**

* Preferring other cultures
* Wanting to help a specific group of people: those who can afford a trip to Europe, North America or Australia.
* Anarchist argument: borders are not natural. People should be free
* Eruption of WW3
* The state may have long term geopolitical goals requiring a large population: 
   * USA in the pioneering of the continent. 
   * The settling of the Volga of the Russian empire.
   * Etc.
* Cheaper labour. 
   * Good for a market economy.
   * Bad for worker wages.

&#x200B;

**Invalid arguments for continued mass immigration:**

* Moral responsibility to help all ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù 
   * Flawed as it does nothing to improve the situation in the world other than helping a small number of individuals in living more comfortable lives.
      * A small minority of migrants are fleeing violence and can be considered refugees. 
      * That minority shall of course be given asylum. However, on a temporary basis, until the conflict is resolved. 
      * This will end the incentive of economic migrants (the large majority) to pack up and move
* ‚ÄúWhite guilt‚Äù 
* No comment‚Ä¶ 
   * Even if white guilt existed as a premise from where to argue. The guilt would be better spent developing former colonies rather than having to relocate their populations to Europe, North America & Australia.

&#x200B;

**Valid arguments against continued mass immigration:**

* Money better spent developing under-developed countries. 
   * 2 most efficient ways to bring a level 1 state into level 2: (Hans Rosling)
      * Build schools 
      * Build hospitals
      * As a result of equalised health outcomes, low child mortality, and family planning, family sizes go down, and population growth slows in a predictable way (Hans Rosling)
      * Side note: a majority of migrants come from income level 2 and 3, not income level 1. Thus, those in the direst need only receive help today from private charities, NGOs, and foreign aid programmes.
* The people who manage to migrate to the EU,US,AUS belong to the more productive members of society in their home states: thereby causing a loss of productivity in their home states and thus slower development of home country.
* Mass immigration leads to the demise of unique cultures. 
   * Ethnic Swedes (a proxy carrying Swedish culture) will be a minority in Sweden in less than 30 years
* Climate change argument: we have four billion people moving into level 3 sooner or later = massive increases in the human carbon footprint
   * We need to help develop these states into level 4 in order to counter the looming climate threat and balance the world population under 10 billion. 	
   * Premise for climate argument: (based on the four income levels of nations by Hans Rosling)
      * Income level 1: (1 Billion people): Small carbon footprint but unsustainable population growth. The never ending population growth will lead to a large carbon footprint from this group.
      * Income level 2: (3 Billion people): Less small carbon footprint and unsustainable population growth.	The never ending population growth will lead to a large carbon footprint from this group.	
      * Income level 3: (2 billion people): Big carbon footprint and unsustainable population growth. The never ending population growth will lead to a very large carbon footprint from this group very fast.
      * Income level 4: (1 billion people): Big carbon footprint and stable population. No growth. 
      * Populations with less comfort in their lives (level 1-3) do not have the luxury of caring for the environment. This concern is a luxury exclusive to level 4.
      * Current population trends are strong enough that by 2100, only \~10% of the world population will be in Western nations (North America, Western Europe) ‚Äî Africa will quadruple in population and Asia will increase about 25%.¬†It will be a¬†very¬†different world.
      * As billions look to improve their lot, and are now able to do so, human power is replaced by machine power, which takes¬†great amounts of energy. With 80% of it currently coming from fossil fuels, what will we do?

&#x200B;

**Invalid arguments against continued mass immigration:**

* ‚ÄúThey take our jobs/women‚Äù 
   * A job/woman is not a right
* Racism 
   * No comment

&#x200B;

**Solution:**

* Temporary asylum for all refugees until the conflict in the home state is resolved.
   * This will eliminate most immigration and still help those in need. 
   * This will save money better spent on development projects in underdeveloped states.

Politically I used to be a centrist, leaning left. I was brainwashed by CNN, as in Europe that's pretty much where you get your information re: American politics from. When Trump was elected, I bought into the whole he's a racist idiot propaganda and repeated the NPC headlines when arguing with friends. 

Then President Trump started going on about FAKE NEWS, and I was thinking, what the hell is he on about? So I did some digging, I listened to some of his full speeches (especially the ones the MSM pieces together to make him sound racist) and had the aha revelatory moment. I recommend his speech 'Trump's entire speech to Muslim world' btw.

From there, a whole new world opened up. I saw the same thing happen to Salvini in the media, with him being smeared as a racist (I'm Italian, he's our Trump). I learned about all the evil perpetuated by the Clintons and the Russia collusion hoax, amongst a myriad of other things. I saw how the supposedly tolerant people of the left were suppressing free speech through mob harassment and/or violence, pretending to care about minorities but just dividing people by color/sexual orientation rather than uniting them by strength of character and moral values. Watching them pander to minorities in patronizing ways, I understood they were the real racists. 

Through Youtube, I came across the left's new vocabulary. SJW/microaggressions/preferred pronouns..., and that there are unlimited genders. I'm a free speech absolutist, 110% against political correctness and believe in science, so I hated this crap. I watched compilations of these crazy people, and though they were hilarious but I started pondering whether I was in the wrong camp.

It was a real pleasure discovering that the right were in fact not racists, but people with a sense of humor, who are proud of the country they come from, and don't want the government taking all their money to redistribute to those who are not willing to work as hard to succeed. Italy used to be like this, and I was always proud of my flag. I also changed my stance on gun ownership and abortion, after actually researching both sides' arguments in depth, rather than taking someone else's opinion of what was 'moral' at face value. 

Today's historic day with the DMZ crossing was the cherry on the cake re: my respect for President Trump, all that he has done, and all that he continues to do for the freedom of America, and inspiring the resurgence of national pride and unity throughout Europe. I'm not sure Salvini would have been elected without him, and he has also been saving our country.

Thank you Mr. President for teaching me to think for myself, if it wasn't for you I'd probably think Antifa were heroes.

Love T_D, you guys are hilarious. Cheers",Hokuto_Shinken

Not a crazy liberal but enough of one to not question voting for Hillary, even though I was not excited about the idea of her being president. 

About a year after Trump got into office I took a red pill and realized how dangerously unhinged the left has become. I realized their dishonesty and immoral techniques. Growing up in the liberal hell hole that is the Seattle area, I was never exposed to conservatism. Thank god I found it. 

I‚Äôm fairly new to reddit but I have known about T_D for a while. Everyone always described it as a cesspool. After being in here for only a few days I already love it.

It's never been a popular opinion(born and raised in Los Angeles California), but my political philosophies align with republicanism. Anyways, recently democrats that know about my political beliefs have been telling me that I won't be accepted by Republicans because I'm brown skin and non-religious, but primarily because I don't practice a religion.

&#x200B;

First of all ... I'm capable of living my life not being accepted for being non-religious lol. Why would that bring me down? Second of all... is it true though?

&#x200B;

Are non-religious republicans accepted? I understand that religion plays a strong role in the lives of many Americans(Democrats included), but is it such an important role that non-religious folk get ostracized in politics?

WOW. I FUCKING LOVE YOU ALL.

Look at the sheer density of the yellow areas. One dot = one person, and those solid yellow blocks are apartment blocks, so the density makes sense. But if you move to the right of that dense yellow in the center, the yellow is still extremely dense, and those are all ""single family homes"". Compare the hispanics in ""single family homes"" to the whites in ""single family homes"" to the left of the center. The truth is that every inch of floor space in both apartments and homes, in LA, including illegally converted spaces  (why start following the law now) are packed with single renters, most illegal. And the illegals are not even represented on this map.  


This overwhelming density is why CA and LA are a mess, and why the LA school system is complete trash. And they ARE getting free schooling and healthcare. E.R.s CAN NOT TURN AWAY ANYONE. That's the law. So they pack and overcrowd our emergency rooms as their primary care facility.   


This city was founded in 1948 and had a provision that any home or land owner needed to be white, and it stayed that way until 1968, with the civil rights act. Now, I don't believe in racial discrimination like that, but one thing that has happened is that in less than 40 years, it has gone from a post-war, white GI family oriented American suburb into a Tijuana ghetto.  


This is the ""photo"" from the Panorama City wiki page.  


  


[FAKE Panorama City](https://i.redd.it/ce8jes7k9j731.jpg)

It's an artist rendering of an upscale shopping complex that has been stalled for a decade because they ""want"" to put in right in the middle of the biggest ghetto in the San Fernando Valley, right on the most violent, hispanic gang ridden street that has shootings at least once each week. And that's what they pretend this Mexican Mecca looks like. ""Hey Americans! They like the same stuff you do! Welcome them!""  


Only this is what Panorama City ACTUALLY looks like:  


[Tijuana PC](https://i.redd.it/fiqr1k25aj731.jpg)

If you have ever been to Tijuana, or any other border town ghetto, this is what they look like. And it's only gotten worse. The mayor has declared that LAPD are not allowed to stop street vendors or illegal sidewalk food booths from illegally selling food and ghetto trash, so the streets are now lined daily and nightly with popup tents of people selling crap and food that they are preparing and cooking right on the dirty sidewalks.  


This is LA, and it will be the new America.  


And I'll close by saying that I feel the same way about immigration as you all do: that I LOVE to see law abiding immigrants that have gone through the system and process and aspire to become a part of the country that they have worked hard to get to. These fucks that invade, hate America, and spend every moment turning it into the shitholes that they left, need to go back to their shitholes.",hiddentrumpla

Cement is largely made up of calcium oxide. When it reacts with water, it produces highly alkaline (high pH) calcium hydroxide that can reach a pH of 12 or higher within a couple of minutes. This is why dry cement is less caustic than wet cement. Remember that the pH tells us how acidic or alkaline a solution is on a scale of 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most alkaline), with a neutral pH being about 7. So, because the pH of wet cement is so high, it can cause burns.

I was turned on to Andy by watching Tim Pool videos in the past. Like Tim, I do not agree with everything he says, but I enjoy his content and appreciate the hard work he does. 

I know military men that lost limbs in battle, mothers that have given birth to triplets, parents that fought off sharks to save their kids and elderly that have been through the great depression with their heads held high, and no one can even fathom the strength it takes to carry around the titanium nuts that Andy carries everyday.

Andy, even though I am a conservative and you are a liberal (classic left leaning centrist) I support you and wish you a full recovery. I hope that you have inspired others to take on the risks you have so you do not need to share this burden forever. Thank you for your strength, willpower, and desire to do the right thing.

Trump supporters have been real patient and taken a lot of abuse in real life and online. Support for a great President like you should be from everyone Sir.

Only the DoJ can set things right and avoid further escalations.

While we wait for justice, every place where we communicate and discuss your great works online is being blocked and meddled with. We may not have long here on Reddit.

&#x200B;

Please President Trump, check in with AG Barr and make sure he is following through.

Nobody knows better than you that this can never happen to another President and the only way to be sure is to make examples.

To those who are honest about you, and the supporters like me who love and adore you, the name Trump already means excellence.

The only thing that is missing is to ensure that your enemies and those who flaunted the law to harm you can learn to associate the name Trump with a healthy dose of Fear of Law and Order.

Again, examples need to be made.

Every day I look to see what the administration has accomplished, and the list is impressive, but every day this cloud hangs above us all knowing that our political foes have literally been getting away with murder.

I'm terrified of the D20 that raised their hands to basically open borders, what they dont realise is that we have a culture here. A function of nationalism is to preservation of culture. If we suck everyone from every other country, their culture dies as much as ours does. The ideological diversity of the entire planet will become homogeneous through technology and we will become a global group think. (What many on the left is gunning for along with a unified world gov.) You my ""sick individuals"" are the flu that makes us stronger. You sit and you grind through the data, you question without fear, you fight for what you believe to be personal truth. You commit to life, liberty and, the pursuit of happiness and fight selflessly for others though you get ridiculed and besmerched. The time of Donald will pass but this movement is the right hemisphere to counter the left. Though your visibility has been cut dramatically, Do not cease, do not falter, do not give up.

Obama and his cohort have been--are still--ruthlessly blackmailing important members of the federal government, including Chief Justice Roberts, which explains Roberts' mystifying rulings over the last few years, incongruent with his previous judicial record.

Roberts is still being manipulated by the Obama shadow government and it has to be stopped ASAP if the Supreme Court is ever to recover its original role in govenment. Right now, it's being used as a tool of the Obama shadow government to thwart Trump's legitmate powers.

For example:

**Yet Another Outrageous and Purely Political Decision** (s*pectator.org*):

>Roberts is clearly saying that he and at least four other of his  colleagues reserve the right to decide what ‚Äúgenuine justifications‚Äù for policy are. He doesn‚Äôt even attempt to suggest that this has anything  to do with law. And the U.S. Supreme Court was established to decide  matters of law, not matters of political judgment. But in recent years  so many judicial decisions have been handed down on the basis of little  more than ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this because I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

Almost everyone has something to hide---except, of course, for GEOTUS. In Roberts' case, it's rather sad. Apparently, there are possible illegalities in the adoption of his two children from Ireland.

>NOTE: Watch ""John Roberts was BLACKMAILED into changing his vote on OBAMACARE"" on Youtube for a likely explanation of why Obama has Roberts by the balls. (I don't know about so-called 'audio 'proof', but the explanation of the adoption problem seems to make sense.)

Obama decapitated the American military, disenfranchised Congress, seized control of the Supreme Court, and established a shadow government, which is poisoning our republic to this very day. If Trump and Barr fail, we are lost, our freedom is gone.

**Does anyone know a way to press the centrality of this issue on AG Barr, or bring it to his attention? He may be considering it now, but he has to make it one of his chief goals: it can't wait 'til later. None of his hard work , or Trump's, will change a thing for us unless Obama's shadow goverment is completely dismantled and its leaders exposed and imprisoned.**",VoxVulgaris

I did some digging myself and found out the rabbit hole went way deeper than I'd thought and, mostly out of fear, I voted less for Donald, but against Hillary.

I won't say what state i live in for personal safety, but it is a very blue state, to the point where people at my work openly talk about progressivism and feminist ideology like it's second nature. I never really believed it myself, but in the theatre world those types of folks are pretty common. But I digress.

The feeling that came over me when Trump took the lead in the election was... indescribable. It was such a wave of relief that we weren't going to see the third world war in this decade, but there was also this rising unease, as I knew things were going to change, and I didn't know if they were for the better or worse.

And now I sit here, three years later, and I see what he's done in just these years, and I look and see how much of an absolut monster these leftists have turned into. Any spell over me or assumption I had of these people are gone; they are a party of power; not the bold, empowering and righteous power behind Trump, but more of a draining, vile power attained through tyranny.

To an extent, Trump has done everything he promised in his campaign. I haven't seen a single Democrat in my quarter of a century in life get one of their policies through, at least one that benefited the country in any way.

Trump is for the people. And hopefully he inspires more politicians of his calibur and grit to run after his two terms are up. And I say two terms because no one, not even my personal Dem hopeful Tulsi (maybe 2024? She might turn out batso before then but who knows) has a chance of taking this absolute powerhouse.

I lived in Orange County and she in LA county in 2016, actually, I was living with my mother for 4 months in Riverside looking to buy my house in OC (bought one in Laguna Beach in case you were curious, go me!) literally DURING the 2016 election.

&#x200B;

I pathetically have to admit..... I did not vote for Trump.   Sitting on my mom's couch laughing about the whole thing, I remember after seeing South Carolina go to Trump, I said to my excited mother ""Wow, you guys actually are going to win this.""

&#x200B;

2020 Trump has not only my vote and my fiance's vote (who DEFINITELY didn't vote Trump in 2016), but I have been spreading the word about how flat out evil Progressives are and therefor, the Democratic Party they took over.

&#x200B;

I personally will count for at least 20 new votes for Trump, hopefull all you are all doing your work too.

You may need to stop using the app. Maybe switch to a third-party one, or just use a browser.

You may even have to change browsers. Drop the one from mega-corp and use something open-source -- something from people who don't want or need to control your mind.

I know, I know -- ""private companies can do what they want"". Of course, that's a lie both ways. Everybody and everything is regulated in one way or another, and mega corps are all ""public"" companies -- publicly traded, and regulated by the SEC, if nothing else. If the SEC told them to support the First Amendment and not censor based on politics or ideology, you think they'd go private and stop getting rich from our markets? Hardly. But , even so, okay.

So, sacrifice a little time ""transitioning"" to freer tools. Sacrifice a little effort in using something less convenient.

Just never sacrifice your freedom. Because it isn't just your freedom. It's your, your kids, your families' and friends'. It's everybody's freedom, now and in the future. What we lose, they may never have.

I've been lurking here just quietly upvoting people for pretty much the whole time our great president has been in office. Ironically enough when he first started campaigning I was in tech school just been discharged from the Navy. My roommates consisted of a future Marine and a Marine that took one too many bullets to his body to be allowed to stay enlisted. When the three of us first heard he was running officially we all laughed our asses off and assumed it would just be a joke thing kinda like everyone keeps saying Arnold should run for office. Well the joke was on us as he basically went on the equivalent of a reenactment of Alexander the Great's conquering of the world. Originally I was a supporter of that pathetic excuse for a man Jeb Bush but I heard them talk on both sides and The Donald just made him look so ridiculous and pathetic that I couldn't not support the superior man. The years have gone by now and while I don't agree with everything he's done I can definitely say that he is without a doubt the best thing that has happened to my country in a good century and we need to make sure he is around for his second term so that he can continue to fix things.

Sure, it'll drive up our debt. Yeah, we would have trouble keeping our doctors... but, the most important thing of all is we would lose our FREEDOM!

When the government controls a system, they choose the winners and losers in that system. 

Let's say one of your parents has a terminal illness. The family may choose to fight, to keep fighting and spending time with family until the end. Unfortunately, you don't get to make that choice. Your parent will be a burden to society and cost the government too much money. Sorry...

Take the case in the UK of the pregnant young lady with down syndrome. The COURT determined she would have to have an abortion. A higher court over ruled that decision, but the potential for a court to determine what life is worth living should be a real fucking wake up call.

I'm preaching to the choir here, but just wanted everyone to have another arrow in their quiver in the fight against socialism. The government should not determine who gets what treatment, who lives and who dies, and what is best for an individual when it comes to health.

Here is a question to make a liberal head explode: If the courts overturned Roe v Wade *and* the government funded healthcare were the law of the land, what would happen to the women who wanted to abort their child? The sword cuts both ways.

TLDR: Government funded healthcare takes away the individuals freedom to choose which care is right.",RandomUN987654

That direction being a society where the government controls everything, and most importantly tries to control outcomes, where the surface goal is to deliver justice and equality, but the underlying goal is consolidation of power. It is the only explanation that makes any sense. 

The latest example of this is the quarantine of the_donald.

Stop and think about this for a minute. They have almost the ENTIRE internet in their control. Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Reddit - the biggest companies in the world, virtually every media organization, academic institutions, a good chunk of the government, are all against us. 

Yet they feel threatened by a community of 750,000 people. Why?

Because they cannot allow us to think for ourselves and make up our mind. 

While I do not have any revolutionary ideas, or unique perspectives, I can speak from my own experience. 

I am a legal non-white immigrant to the United States. I considered myself a liberal for the most part of my life. I can speak at length about my world view which brought me to this community, but I will save that for another time. I want to talk about my experience serving on Team Space Force, which is a mod team comprising of regular mods and several temp mods, of which I was one. 

I spoke with the moderators at the beginning of the term, and they were well aware of my background, and yet I never once experienced any form of discrimination towards me. They were unabashedly pro American, but aren't we all? They did not care about my skin color, nor my ethnic background, both of which are beyond my control. They cared about my allegiance, my technical competence, and my dedication to the task at hand. 

I was honorably discharged from service on my birthday. A great honor. 

During my service, I have never once witnessed the mods condone violence, racism, white supremacy or anything remotely close to that. Yet here we are, accused of crimes we never committed. 

I will begrudgingly give credit to the socialists where the credit is due. They are excellent smear merchants. This is the modern day version of being branded as a heretic.

If you are new to this community, I ask that you take a few minutes of your time and judge this community for yourself. It is entirely possible that you do not like it, then so be it. I respect your right to dislike us, but all I ask before you cast judgement is to pause for a second and give us a chance. God knows, the rest of planet won't.

God bless you, god bless our President Trump, and may god bless these United States of America.",PatchRowcester

The main reason for that is the debates around censorship, freedom of speech and opinion and political correctness.

&#x200B;

I've always upheld my idea that freedom of speech, opinion and thought are sacred cows, censorship of any sort is terrible and that political correctness is more or less just the uptightness of the 50s and 60s conservatives with a sligthly different flavor.

&#x200B;

So, I abhor this place being censored and I find it absolutely disgusting what AntiFa is doing with throwing quick drying cement on people, beating them into the hospital and so on. Not to mention that -actual- radical boards here on Reddit that either call for violence or rejoice in seeing people being beaten don't get the same treatment.

&#x200B;

Trump ought to be lauded for what he gets right and booed for what he gets wrong, like any other president. He's a bit of a doofus to me to be honest but he's got plenty of things right despite that.

It's not easy to legally immigrate to the states. If criminals can walk across the border and claim the right to citizenship, the decades of work (and taxes) that my family members have put in and continue to put in are rendered laughable. They earned their citizenship and did not claim it as a matter of right.

I also support Mr. Trump's moves to defend US industry -- yes, even the IT industry -- and I am happy that he has pulled back from the Middle East. If Clinton had been elected, the Middle East would have had more wars, not less and the world would be more unstable, not less. If Clinton had been elected, there'd also have been less pushback against the identity politics madness that seems to have seized parts of the States. Men, white people and Christians would be even bigger targets of abuse and racism than they are now - and I'm neither white, nor Christian.

The t\_d quarantining is absolute bullshit and I think it's going to bite the left in the ass, just as the smug dismissal of Trump's viability as a presidential candidate came back to bite the left in the ass. Barring Sanders and Gabbard, who are both also deeply flawed, every single 2020 democratic candidate seems to be frantically pushing identity politics and prioritising foreigners, illegal immigrants and minorities over the interests of the majority of Americans. WTF.I think Mr. Trump has it wrong about climate change - or at least, I'm not at all sure he has it right and I think that unilaterally pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran was wrong but I support t\_d and have subscribed out of disgust at the quarantining.

Right now, Biden is leading, but once he fall behind Kamala in ratings he'll drop and endorse her. Obama's endorsement will eventually follow after that. You can already see this plan from the debate and Bidens' speeches. 

I have watched a lot of Kamala's congressional hearings. The cadence of her speech while ""attacking"" Biden during debate is tailored to evoke memories of Obama. I think the theatrical back-and-forth with Biden is hilariously contrived especially part where he gave up the mic.

Oprah will be their ""insurance policy"". She's already being AB tested in Maher's show.

Except here. The results were news articles talking about the quarantine, not a direct link. I tried searching for ""reddit <quarantined sub>"", for other subs that are in quarantine, and usually (not always, but usually) the first result was a link.

Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo all returned direct links.

While it won't do any good, submit bugs to Google about the issue. On the search page, scroll to the bottom, click the ""Send feedback"" button, and describe the issue. That will at least let Google know we are watching them, and are aware of their nefarious actions.

Long time Reddit lurker since about 2005 (came here after Digg.) Been following /r/the_donald since before the 2016 election. I was a big time Ron Paul supporter in 2008 and 2012. Totally support Trump today. It's shocking how Reddit and other big tech platforms have changed from a libertarian/free speech stance to unapologetically censoring conservative voices. Also how the left has went from a liberal position to full-blown socialist/SJW. All my favorite right-leaning commentators (Alex Jones, PJW, Milo, ect.) have been completely banned from Reddit/Facebook/Twitter, etc. for bogus reasons. Not to mention the Google search result manipulation. How long will this go on? I don't care about karma as I rarely post, just wanted to show my appreciation for this Dom. There are many like me out there who mostly lurk but enjoy visiting here every day for some refreshing real news.",MrGuy1988

7857,"People who don't know Marianne Williamson might think she's just a mildly entertaining kook, but it is actually very unsettling to see her on the stage running for President of the United States, regardless of her having no chance of winning. She is a master deceiver, taught by the best. (long...)",93,c792fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c792fv/people_who_dont_know_marianne_williamson_might/,29,2019-06-30 07:30:39,"Just for my fellow pedes' personal information, I really thought I should take a minute to shed some light on who Marianne Williamson is.  She is the leading mouthpiece for a mind and moral bending cult whose main book is ""A Course in Miracles.""  She is not the origin of the book or the cult, but under her promotion, it gained a great following.  Any of you who live in a metro area, I'd bet anything there are groups that meet to study ""A Course in Miracles.""

The origin of ""A Course in Miracles"" is this.  A ""Jewish"" (actually atheistic) psychologist named Helen Shucman began hear a voice dictated in her head in 1956.  She fought it off for a long time, but it would not go away.  It told her it would not leave her alone until she wrote down everything it wanted her to write.  Beginning in 1965 and up through 1972 she wrote down what she was told.  At some point, it turned from her writing what she heard and into a sort of ""auto writing.""  She says she was writing but not of her own power.  These things are corroborated as much as can be by Bill Thetford, a clinical psychologist who she worked with during all this time (she wasn't a patient) at Columbia University.  After its completion, but before its publication in 1975, the voice told Helen it was Jesus Christ.

It is difficult to sum up or talk about what is taught in ""A Course in Miracles.""  It is self-contradictory in ways that make one's brain hurt, and yet somehow seem enlightened as you read them.  I will try though, shortly.

The reason I am familiar with this is because when I was in my 20s, I was pulled into exploring these teachings.  I did not seek them out.  I had a good friend (or so I thought) for several years who seemed like a very spiritually enlightened person, and I was ""searching.""  It was only after getting closer to him and trusting him for several years that I read a book he recommended called ""A Return to Love.""  It is by Marianne Williamson, and it is all about ""A Course in Miracles.""  At that time, I had absolutely no idea what the origin of ""A Course in Miracles"" was.  I thought it was just something someone wrote on their own.  I also began reading ""A Return to Love"" with a very open mind because I trusted the person who gave me the book.

A person who takes to heart the teachings of ""A Course in Miracles"" can very easily find themselves in self destructive patterns of behavior and in denial about the reality of bad influences in their life.  It teaches that there is no sin (or ""wrong"" if you prefer) and that guilt and suffering are illusions of our own minds.  It teaches that we are already ""in Heaven with God"" and we just have to ""wake up"" to see it.  It's hard for me to even type these things.  They are morally twisted, so bear with me.  ""The Course"" teaches many things that make no sense, but a person taking them to heart will begin to think they just need to ""love"" away their problems.

Such a person will endure abuse of many types, believing they just aren't loving and forgiving enough.  ""The Course"" advocates self abuse, without calling it that.  And a person who believes all suffering and guilt are imagined will not have the proper urgency to address true injustice.  After all, we're already in Heaven.  It is wholly antithetical to Christian teaching, but the, whatever it was, dictating to this woman said it was Jesus Christ.  This fake ""Jesus"" says that the way to ""reach Heaven"" is essentially to just ignore everything bad and pretend there is no right or wrong.

Of course I no longer believe any of these things, but because of my trust in the person who showed me these things, I did try in earnest to be open-minded... to take them seriously... for a long time.  I can tell you, for all the time I did so, I knew nothing but suffering spiritually.  I stayed in many situations and around many people who I shouldn't have.

For all of these reasons, I am frankly quite disturbed to see Marianne Williamson on stage for Presidential debates.  She is not the one who wrote ""A Course in Miracles.""  However, she is the one who wrote ""A Return to Love""... and that is the book that has drawn literally millions of people toward ""A Course in Miracles.""  Interestingly, in ""A Return to Love""... there is no honest account of the origins of ""A Course in Miracles""... probably because most people would turn tail immediately if they read it.

I know not all of us here use this same language, but I also know many of us do.  I've believed for quite some time that there's a large battle we are a part of here, despite the fact that we often have a lot of fun with it.  I believe this is a battle of good vs evil, at its core.  Seeing Marianne Williamson spreading her name and her message as a democrat primary candidate only further solidifies that for me.",IAM_HeavenlyTrumpet

This shows perfectly that the democrats don't care about helping people and that they just want power. If Cubans voted democrat I can promise that would still be a policy that exists.

I have to admit though, i laughed my ass off at the fact that, just a few days after Trump wisely averted escalating hostilities qith Iran, HBO aired a tv show which portrays the US as the agressor in a nuclear war against China. These liberal retards actually think that Trump would authorize a first strike with nukes against China. That is how delusional they are. The show made my wife and I so angry, it basically portrayed America and Trump as war mongering fascists. 

Furthermore, All the ""protagonists"" are token characters: a gay couple, a interracial family, a single mother (who is disabled) with 2 children from two different men (both asian), and evil racist old white woman, a trans child, and a gay middle eastern refugee. It's like they tried to jam every liberal stereotype into a handful of characters. It's so over the top that it is ridiculous and frankly beyond belief.

These social media giants are suppressing free speech and communities which are far from even teetering on the edge of any ""rules violation"".  My wife enlightens me a few times a week with r/The_Donald content from posts and threads.  I had been reluctant to join some of these groups because I just don't have to the time although I certainly share the passion. Well when she told me about the r/The_Donald Quarantine aka ""Conservative Censorship"", I decided to JOIN the group in defiance of this despicable practice.  So J-Skizzles is now OFFICIALLY part of the r/The_Donald community!  

This was only possible after two password resets (wtf?) and having to recieve a shared link (btw more Conservative Censorship) to finally join this community.

And not only did that not work, it is actually doing the opposite because now people who are curious about this ""heinous community"" check out the sub to see how bad it is, then to their surprise they find out that the people here are pretty chill and mature.

So it gets said outsiders thinking, that hey, this quarantine is not right. So not only does reddit get exposed as being obviously biased, but also it strengthens this sub due to new people joining out of protest or enjoying what the sub has to offer and decide to stick around. 

Honestly this is karma at work. 

While i personally joined out of protest and so will probably not post or join any debates here because American politics are simply not interesting to me, I still got my eyes opened by this situation so now ill be more hesitant to simply believe whatever negative rumors people say about you.

This Quarantine is BS!  You know what? Never mind! I‚Äôm glad they are putting a barrier between their disgusting selves and us patriots!

My story: I did not vote in 2016. I was disgusted. I thought EVSGDRGEOTUS was a fraud. A disgusting Bill Clinton pretending to be a Ron Paul. I don‚Äôt consider myself a ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù, I‚Äôm more a conservative, with some libertarian views, and some few areas I haven‚Äôt yet truly decided.
I voted for Sarah Palin, and was disgusted she was backstabbed by that traitor whom shall not be named, that was on the ticket with her. If not for Sarah, his defeat would have been even more humiliating!

On Election Day 2016, I told my friends Trump is going to win. I just hope he‚Äôs not a liar, but I think he is...
 I WAS WROOOOOONG!! 
The man is awesome! Promises kept? Are you kidding me? The god emperor is a promise fulfillment  machine!
He has been blessed by the one true God. It is clear to see to all who know Him. (Hello? Trump curse?)

I am fully onboard. My lurking has ended. Team Trump has my 2020 vote in the bag. He said on the Time mag interview he‚Äôs not going to try to get swing voters... I said YES!! Hold on to your values and Don‚Äôt give in! üëçüëç

I also have 3 (liberal) friends who went to North Korea years ago (maybe 6-8). Who told me about it. And I also followed North Korea for a while before Trump.

And there is a quite some change there. The propaganda there seems to be more and more aligned with peace an prosperity,  oppsed to anti-american war mongering (it's obviously still there).

The tourists have more freedom of movement. apparently the supermarkets are more stocked.

It's really interesting to see how NK is changing since Trump.

PLEASE support this, as this can have a huge effect as the 2020 Election gets closer.

Every time President Trump makes a post on Twitter, he is brigaded by crazy trolling leftists. They spam him on multiple tweets a day, and they say lewd, profane, or completely inappropriate things. There are lots of people who see the responses to his tweets, and the unhinged leftists affect everyone's perception of President Trump. There are usually pro-Trump folks who respond, but it can vary as to the tweet.

As we're leading up to the 2020 Election, PERCEPTION CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. If crazy leftists believe they're gaining traction, it helps motivate them (and others).  We need a crushing victory in November 2020 to help extinguish some of the crazy leftism.

My request is you subscribe to @realDonaldTrump and soon (within minutes) after President Trump posts a tweet, ""like/heart"" each of the pro-Trump replies to his tweet in the tweet thread and potentially even reply to the pro-Trump tweets with support. I'm not sure of the exact algorithm, but more likes and replies certainly would help. If you don't have a Twitter account, make one!

Obviously, I also think it's 100% fair to troll leftist trolls who troll President Trump on his own damn Twitter feed. Fight fire with fire, right?

So:  
1. Subscribe to @realDonaldTrump  
2. Monitor for President Trump's tweets  
3. Soon after one is posted, like/heart Trump's tweet and retweet it  
4. IMPORTANT!  Like/heart pro-Trump responses in the tweet response thread  
5. Potentially reply to pro-Trump responses in the tweet response thread and potentially reply to leftist trolls with comments IN KIND to the type they've made.

I make this post because I know there are a lot of pedes here who may not be active on Twitter and may not realize some of the negative spam-trolling that President Trump gets on a daily basis. Pedes on here could help turn Trump's Twitter account even more positive/pro-Trump and drown out some of the unhinged leftist troll spam. And that's what it generally is: trolling spam and negativity.

Criticism is fine, but it's often F THIS and F THAT and TRUMP IS LYING HITLER and just bullshittery.

This is a worthy cause. PLEASE support this as you have time.  Even if you're only doing it occasionally, it helps.

For instance, after every one of my posts in our favorite lelneutralunbiasedpoliticalsubreddit, i've begun to use a copy/pasta comment at the end of each post that elaborates on why I most likely will not respond to everyone that replies to my comments. As we all know, the timer limits us to around 10 minutes between each of our posts, due to the fact that if you're a conservative, you're gonna have negative karma on 80% of reddit. Personally, i'm pretty sure I have like -10k in redacted alone. This makes it extremely difficult to respond to all of the comments. Even if you have a valid response to a question, you're most likely going to be spammed by multiple redditors and be unable to provide them all with your answer. This happens to me constantly, and as a busy individual who simply visits reddit while taking a dump, I don't have time to respond to at most one-two comments per poop.

You'll find that since a place like our favorite political subreddit is generally an echo chamber of leftists, they don't have to deal with the response timer since they normally have high karma from spamming ""orange man bad."" A lot of them don't even know it exists. I'm constantly receiving additional comments such as ""lol guess he's not responding"" when I'm literally sitting there waiting for the remaining 5 minutes to pass in order to post a response.

For instance, the comment I generally add is:

Insertsubreddithere *users, if you wish to converse with me, please do so in individual private messaging. Due to this subreddits reply timer, I cannot respond to the plethora of comments I receive. Thank you!*

Of course, the drawback to this is that you'll be speaking more in PMs, but I've had success with it so far. People are a little less reluctant to PM you anyway, so it should probably even out.",Fletchicus

For my first time voting, I voted for Obama because of the promises he offered. I was going to vote for Trump for the next election until a professor talked me out of it. For the next two years, I lived in one of the countries that sends caravans of migrants. I actually knew about it a few months in advance and knew 2 women that went there (they went to work not because they're in danger). Living here, I've started a family and assuming all of the responsibility of being a husband. I realized that it is much better for me to get the things that I need instead of relying on others. What tipped me over to Trump confidently is protecting my country and family. The people in the Central American country I live in are not civil like Americans in the sense that my wife cannot walk two blocks without someone trying to touch her ( we go everywhere now together). What I realized is that if the migrants come to the United States, none of my family will be safe. Because of this I'm extremely greatful for his work and him building the wall. Obviously I can't reveal myself because of my safety. Americans are hated here and they bring that same hate to the United States. But living in a caravan country, I whole heartly support Trump.

1A Dhammaraja from America¬†

The situation which has led to the Tsar of Russia having to relinquish the¬†throne was \[brought about by himself\]. He refused to adapt himself to¬†¬†progressive groups, which had become very vociferous, and to make timely¬†concessions to them. One can not Ô¨Åght progressives. It might be asked why one¬†should not listen to conservatives also, since they are there; the answer is that¬†conservatives can never harm the king because it would be against their¬†beliefs. Progressives are capable of anything, and therefore one has to consider¬†them more than conservatives. ConÔ¨Çict between the two is normal, but¬†conservatives have never prevailed and containment is only temporary; in the¬†end it will be as desired by the progressives.‚Äî¬†

I have to say, so far this quarantine has been going pretty well. 

When I browse the front page, in the whole display my eyes naturally go to rest on one of those big fat yellow QUARANTINED labels down below each one of t_d's posts. Then my eyes automatically jump to the next label and so on, making it quite easy to filter t_d posts from the rest of reddit. It then reminds me that I am only interested in this sub anyways, so that's also a reminder to just damn go straight to r/The_Donald.

All the exposure we've got since we got 'tined has been awesome so far. It is amazing to see all this people coming into t_d because of the quarantine. Those posts fill me with shivers and so much joy. I am sure I am not the only one who feels this way, and I am certain those people feel welcomed like they have never felt before.

>""look i know theres a lot of good people just looking for a good life, to be americans, truly. These good people who love America, and want to be Americans themselves can do the right thing, not only for the country they want to live in but for themselves. they can turn themselves into ice, be set to be deported to a preferential city (a nicer city that trump and mexico have a deal about) and put on an accelerated track for citizenship""  
  
first i think this has a couple benefits  
  
one: it costs nothing to encourage people to turn themselves in  
  
two: it lowers the population that has to be apprehended by ICE  
  
three: it allows for trump to be much much stronger with ICE policies. theres a path to citizenship.   
  
four: potentially could have benefits for the illegals that get deported, if they get placed in a preferential city, they can work and make money legally etc...  
  
conclusion: leave and come back the right way. if you do it on your own, we will be nicer to you.  
  
  
what do you guys think?  
  
also: think of the meme potential. getting illegals to deport themselves. WINNING",jamisonglory

&#x200B;

LBRY: [https://beta.lbry.tv/](https://beta.lbry.tv/) (sync to Youtube: [https://lbry.com/youtube](https://lbry.com/youtube)) - LBRY will pay creators up to $2,650 to sync their channel with LBRY

[D.tube](https://D.tube): [https://d.tube/](https://d.tube/) (technical sync with YouTube) - rewards creators with a popular cryptocurrencey STEEM

&#x200B;

If you can find more emails, upload them to the Ubuntu pastebin, which is not indexed in search engines, so they won't get spammed by bots. Then post it in the comments.

First, there's probably a lot of money to be made - during and after (speaking engagements, ""foundations"" (i.e. money laundering operations), books, etc).


Second, and most importantly, they are trying to move the needle of public perception of illegal immigrants, healthcare for all, etc.  They know they can't get it done in the next 15-20 years, but they're laying the groundwork for glacially slow societal viewpoint change.  All they're trying to do is plant the seeds of this nonsense to get people thinking and talking about it.

Why does it matter , the color of your skin, or your ""Ancestral heritage"", it's all b\*\*\*sh\*t! No other country says "" American-Belgian"" Or "" American-English"". I think its honestly divisive at its core to give all these different labels. We as a people need to stop adding these prefixes, and just call ourselves Americans, no matter who you are or what you look like, as long as you're not a dirty commie, we're all AMERICAN brothers and sisters, end, period, full stop!",FAFSAPOLICE

We do it to China... The CIA is on the record for supporting separatist Muslims in Xinjiang (far west of China) and the Tibetans. Who would have more to gain than China by funding all these clown world ideas in the US?

The world is basically a zero sum game for resources and power, with the competition being between the West and China.

Russia doesn't have the money to do it. But the far left's rise correlates nicely with China's economic growth (not counting the last 2 years, haha!)

Okay,  I have been on this sub for years,  and never have I seen or read about a call to violence.  The only violence I've seen lately is videos of mobs of antifa attacking a reporter or Red hat maga affiliate. 

They say that some call to violence by some user against Portland Police is what triggered the q. First off,  couldn't that be a plant? Is that all it takes to trigger a q?

Now while I don't know that to be true or fake.  It seems beyond hypocritical of reddit to immediately censor without doing deeper contextual analysis. I.e. is it one rotten apple stinking it up for a community that is respectful,  open to debate,  promotes new ideas,  and cherishes personal happiness and well being without over burden of government.

It feels like the standard that the right is held to is some impossible standard that as soon as someone fights back against the left,  it's like there-there, see,  they are deplorable people, quarantine them.

Meanwhile violence from their side is not only excused, but promoted and then blamed on us.

It does truly feel like we're living in a clown world.

And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.",RedPilledPreacher

After spending a few hours reading posts and hitting upvotes, I think this sub just became my favorite place on the internet. I'm not going to make up a story and claim the quarantine is going to make me vote Trump because I voted for him in 2016 and he already has my vote in 2020. I will say that my wife and I voted for him more as an anti-Hillary vote than a Trump vote. Next time we will be voting for him because of him. 

Now for my advice: Don't give these tech companies a single penny in advertising! I'm not sure links are allowed so for the few of you not doing it already (yes there are some of you out there), please look into these companies and use their software:

* uBlock Origin - If you get only one thing this should be it
* Privacy Badger - Stops tracking. May be redundant but can't hurt. 
* Brave Browser - Privacy browser. At the very least just don't use Chrome. 
* Duck Duck Go - This one I find myself not using as often as I should but at the very least try not to use Google. I would even use Bing (MS sucks too) before using Google. 
* Gab and Dissenter 
* For the more tech savvy out there set up a pihole on your home network. 
* If someone is on multiple platforms, watch their content on any other platform besides youtube. Bitchute, Steemit etc. 

Some of you that use adblock may disable it to allow your favorite youtuber to earn money while watching their videos. I don't recommend this. If you can afford it send them money directly, no matter how small the amount. Don't let youtube collect one penny.",Teufelhunden92

I know this is very old news to most but it still pains me all the time. I used to look at subreddits like murderedbywords, blackpeopletwitter, etc and it's just so upsetting that these meme subreddits have all turned into just anti trump memes ""ooh look, trump spelled this word wrong! Let's get him!"" and that post gets 26k up votes, nothing to do with that actual subreddit at all, just signaling to their other anti right members.

I just don't understand, I see posts about families being ruined, why does it have to be this way? We surely don't do this to them, atleast nobody I've seen on here would. It seems like such a sharp contrast, before it seemed like politics was just that, politics, nowadays I can't step outside wearing the hat of my own president without harrasment (doesn't stop me though).

It just seems like a constant cycle of the left trying to actually ruin America. They mess up big time, forcing everyone to use certain words, forcing everyone to act a certain way, rioting in the streets, faking hate crimes, and then we react and say this is garbage, why would you ever do this, and they just turn around and say it's the right ruining America. The left shoots their own foot and then blames gun control.

Like I said I'm sure this has all been said many times before, but this is my first post here and I really just wish things weren't this way. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest fellow pedes, maybe I'll be less of a lurker soon.",purpleice45

>On July 23, 2016, ahead of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the 2016 DNC Rules Committee voted overwhelmingly (158‚Äì6) to adopt a superdelegate reform package. The new rules were the result of a compromise between the Clinton and the Sanders campaigns; in the past, Sanders had pressed for the complete elimination of superdelegates.

>Under the reform package, in future Democratic Conventions, about two-thirds of superdelegates would be bound to the results of state primaries and caucuses. The remaining one-third‚Äîmembers of Congress, governors, and distinguished party leaders‚Äîwould remain unpledged and free to support the candidate of their choice.

Well, sounds like the problem is solved then, right? Well before you click away, consider this little math issue:

- **Delegates**: 4,767

- **Super Delegates**: 712

So two-thirds of the superdelegates go with the winner of their state, and 1/3 can vote for whoever they want, right? Well if that's the case, then why even have them?

- **474** delegates are bound to vote by state election. 

- **237** will vote for whoever the party tells them to vote for.

So let's establish something right now before we go any further. This rule essentially creates a third-tier of democratic delegates. Ones who can vote for whomever they want.

- **Delegates**: 4,767

- **Super Delegates**: 474

- **Super Duper Delegates**: 237

But who cares? Their vote won't matter, right? Well what happens if there's a fuckton of candidates? Like, 20 of them?

Well a good chunk of them are pretty batshit and have no prospects, but at least a good 12 or so of them are legitimate candidates.

So let's say they're legitimate enough to win a diverse multitude of states. Suddenly that safe 474 is split up a little bit.

**40** delegates per candidate if it's an even race in the beginning.

Suddenly that 237 isn't so insignificant anymore. Now you essentially have a very different set up that the Democrats probably want it all along:

- **Delegates**: 4,767

- **Super Delegates**: 40/candidate

- **Super Duper Delegates**: 237

And now the Democrats are back to square one. Now they can just use these delegates to easily swing the election again away from any unsavory candidates from Vermont that might not tow the party line.

**EDIT**:

Isn't it funny that the Democrats care so much about a national popular vote, but are totally fucking silent about superdelegates which are about as unconstitutional as you can fucking get.",TomToonami93

It should be known in this community that UNICEF is located in Congo and is helping those people get to Mexico City. There are direct flights from PNR to Mexico City. Ebola is consuming much of that region and WHO is being hush hush about how much of an outbreak is occurring. Its spreading from the eastern part of Congo and into Uganda. UNICEF is probably still upset about GEOTUS cutting off aid to them and working against destroying America. The UN is the globalists army along with ISIS.

The hold that the Cartels have is basically undeniable. I feel like the immense mobilization of Mexican National Guard is done because they know damn well, worst comes to worst, America has their back. They're fighting back because plan B isn't surrendering to the Cartels anymore. Plan B is a helping hand from the US of A .

Now leftists are pulling this crap, and it's going to create an entire generation of conservatives.

The difference being we have the moral high ground and social media on our side. This is not an issue the left can ever win.",UltimaterializerX

After spending the last few hours reading through here... there are actually a lot of good posts, well thought out arguments, and valid points... in between all the memes and shitposts Haha. 

I have always held conservative values and have no qualms judging all politicians equally. It is just that most of my views align with the Republican party... even if I wish they would be more libertarian. I have been getting pretty heavily into watching politics the last 6 years or so and I can honestly say I am completely appalled at how far the leftists have fallen.  I thought Obama was bad and now I realize how tame he was.

They argued that he had intent to obstruct when he asked if he could fire Mueller. Ok, makes sense. Except, intent to obstruct is not obstruction of justice. In USC 1503, obstruction of justice is an act that ""corruptly or by threats of force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.""

If I'm understanding this right, in order for ""intent to obstruct"", to be obstruction of justice, there would have to be some form of impediment, obstruction, delay, etc, in the investigation wrought from the intent to obstruct, which means that an action took place that caused the obstruction because the person intended to obstruct.

I say this because, in my opinion, the key word for the intent argument, is ""endeavors"". An endeavor is an action. Mariam Webster states that it is to attempt by exertion of effort, to strive or achieve. Where ""endeavor"" is always associated with an action, cause and effect, intent is not.

However, Reddit and the Chinese that fund them finally decided to get back at Trump and censor the largest gathering of Trump supporters anywhere on the internet. Why are we not allowed to have a space that is ours when even the most disgusting subs exist with impunity and ZERO censorship?

Did you (the visitor) know The\_Donald is the only place on Reddit to access the Donald J. Trump AMA? That AMA is now a matter of national record. Twitter has now begun to censor the President. Are you ok with this?

Why are leftists and tech giants trying to point the finger at Trump supporters when we aren't the ones in control here? We don't own Reddit. We did, like everyone else on Reddit, make space for ourselves on here. Why is that wrong? Why is it ok to censor an ENTIRE FORUM?

Am I required to allow anyone to enter my home and say what they want to me and my family? Why/Why not? The media is oversimplifying a very complex and very real problem just to make themselves look right. The\_Donald is a sub-forum on a platform. That space is the only space it controls (**At least it used to. They've taken mod powers away so they couldn't enforce rules**) and it has a right to remove disruptive trolls. Reddit, on the other hand, is a platform that holds all the keys.

What Reddit has done is to join the ranks of Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and others in becoming the corporate gatekeepers of who gets to participate in democracy. The elephant in the room? This corporate power grab won't spare the left. It will devour them.

Divide that total by the number of American Citizens (adults only, or children too?)

That is your next year's tax for Illegal Alien Invaders. Like FICA, it's a separate call out, and goes into a separate fund, used to pay next year's cost for Illegal Alien Invaders

Repeat each year forever.

Ex: Let's say Illegal Alien Invaders cost the U.S. 300 billion last year.

Let's say there are 100 million adult US citizens

Each adult citizen owes $3000 of Illegal Alien Invader tax. On top of Income and FICA tax.

Of course, if some rich people think that's unfair, they can pay the tax for poorer people. Just set up a foundation and have people apply for relief.

Or, if you don't want to pay the Illegal Alien Invader tax each and every year, forever, and don't want to beg a richer person to pay it for you, you can vote to stop Illegal Alien Invaders from living in and using the resources of this country.

1. Kamala Harris's segregation bullshit  story
2. Dems pandering to the Hispanic community by speaking in Spanish even though if they don't give a sh!t about the community
3. Offering an easy pathway to citizenship to illegals even though there are people in other countries who apply for visas/green cards and wait for years. My parents had to wait for several years in order to get their green card.
4. Dems lying about their stance. Cory Booker takes millions from pharmaceuticals, yet he was still talking bs about how he will destroy them.

I'll probably have to delete and create a new Reddit account soon. The writing community is tight and viciously SJW with TDS. I had previous joined, made an innocuous comment and was soon banned and shadow banned all over the internet. Like on all three of the writing sites I was on. Crazy!

Anyway, my father immigrated from Poland. Only he, my grandmother, and his two older brothers survived the concentration camps. The two older brothers were half German and born of rape. I've never met them. Right or wrong, my grandmother gave them up once she arrived in America. My grandmother was also paralyzed in experiments to determine the cause of paralysis. I say this because I'm sensitive to the mistreatment of groups of people. I'm not a snowflake. I'm a freakin MAN, but I get a sick feeling when groups of people are made to suffer.

I believe Trump supporters are being treated like Jew in Germany 1930 pre war. Dehumanized, assaulted with frequency. Most shocking is how this treatment is justified and encouraged by the left's leadership. For two days, I've posted in subs trying to wake people up to the treatment of Trump supporters. I've been civil, on point, and NOT ONE person has agreed that the treatment of Trump supporters is out of control. Many have wished greater violence.

They spit on a man out to dinner (with his kids?). I have no doubts if a man was killed for wearing a MAGA hat, there would be cheering on the left. I'll probably delete this soon, but I wanted to share. I have some good books I've been polishing for decade, I plan to release them in August, and being a Trump supporter will guarantee me ostrazation and a slew of initial bad reviews. (reddit is where my only one star review came from).

Anyway, thanks to all of you who are braver than me. We can not let the loonies win this world defining election. MAGA #2020",authorTaylorKole

1.	A people free to choose will always choose peace.

2.	Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today‚Äôs world do not have.

3.	Democracy is worth dying for, because it‚Äôs the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.

4.	Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn‚Äôt pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.

5.	How do you tell a communist? Well, it‚Äôs someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It‚Äôs someone who understands Marx and Lenin.

6.	Information is the oxygen of the modern age. It seeps through the walls topped by barbed wire, it wafts across the electrified borders.

7.	It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession. I have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first.

8.	We must reject the idea that every time a law‚Äôs broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.

9.	I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace: to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.

10.	There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn‚Äôt mind who gets the credit.

11.	We in government should learn to look at our country with the eyes of the entrepreneur, seeing possibilities where others see only problems

12.	A leader, once convinced a particular course of action is the right one, must have the determination to stick with it and be undaunted when the going gets rough.

13.	In America, our origins matter less than our destination, and that is what democracy is all about.

14.	The work of volunteer groups throughout our country represents the very heart and soul of America. They have helped make this the most compassionate, generous, and humane society that ever existed on the face of this earth.

15.	The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or the next. It was the deep knowledge ‚Äî and pray God we have not lost it ‚Äî that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest.

16. The government‚Äôs view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.

17. Coercion, after all, merely captures man. Freedom captivates him.

18. The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm from the government and I‚Äôm here to help.‚Äô

19. I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency, even if I‚Äôm in a cabinet meeting.

20. My fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you I just signed legislation which outlaws Russia forever. The bombing begins in five minutes. \[Said during a radio microphone test in 1984\]",JustAPeede

10761,"Quarantine demands a doctor, I recommend Hipocrates. Instructions are as follows:",28,c6t6y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c6t6y7/quarantine_demands_a_doctor_i_recommend/,4,2019-06-29 05:19:13,"We are now in a position to attempt a brief analysis of the Corpus Hippocraticum. For the moment the external evidence of Galen and other ancient commentators, for or against the authenticity of the various treatises, will be passed over. This evidence is of great importance, but may tend to obscure the issue, which is the mutual affinities of the treatises as shown by their style and content.

In the first place the heterogeneous character of the Corpus should be observed. It contains :--

(1) Text-books for physicians ;

(2) Text-books for laymen ;

(3) Pieces of research or collection of material for research.

(4) Lectures or essays for medical students and novices.

(5) Essays by philosophers who were perhaps not practising physicians, but laymen interested in medicine and anxious to apply to it the methods of philosophy.

(6) Note-books or scrap-books.

Even single works often exhibit the most varied characteristics. It is as though loose sheets had been brought together without any attempt at coordination or redaction. Epidemics I., for instance, jumps with startling abruptness from a "" constitution "" of the diseases prevalent at one period in Thasos to the function of the physician in an illness, passing on to a few disjointed remarks on pains in the head and neck. Then follows another "" constitution,"" after which comes an elaborate classification of the ordinary fevers, with their periods, paroxysms and crises. At the end come fourteen clinical histories.

I have already mentioned a pre-Hippocratic group and a Hippocratic group, and it has been noticed that the main task of Greek medicine was to free science from superstition and from philosophic hypotheses. The Corpus contains two polemical works, On Epilepsy and Ancient Medicine, which attack respectively the "" divine "" origin of disease and the intrusion into medicine of the hypothetical speculation of philosophers.

There is another group of works which, while they do not display to any marked degree the Hippocratic characteristics, are nevertheless practical handbooks of medicine, physiology or anatomy. The list is a long one, and includes works by different authors and of different schools :--

The Surgery.

The Heart.

Places in Man.

Glands.

Anatomy.

Nature of the Bones.

Sight.

Dentition.

Diseases I.

Then I grew up. 

I've always had closeted right wing thoughts, but I dismissed them as racism (lol). I even thought Ben Shapiro was homophobic. 

But I still enjoyed an ""SJW owned"" video every now and then. I mean hey, these people aren't liberals! They're SJWs!

Then Dave Rubin helped me realize that there wasn't much of a difference. This was magnified by the occasional Ben Sharpie that helped me realize the ridiculousness of the left. Then I saw more of their ads, and more of Prager.

I protested the second Iraq war (because there were obviously no wmds) and railed against the blatant funneling of money into haliburton during the war.

I voted for Obama. Fell for the hope thing. I started questioning the sanity of my choice after Mike Brown and Trayvon Martin's cases turned into obvious white guilt ploys but thought it would turn around.

Everything changed when our president started throwing truth and the Democrats were lying their asses off during the election. The polls were fake, the news was fake and I realized that there was true Democrat fuckery afoot.

I'm proud that I voted for our president and I'm proud that I'll vote for him.

There is loss in this story. Many old friends have washed their hands of our friendships. They were never truly friends though. People don't walk away from true friends because of democratic pandering.

Something might have hit the news somewhere - given their arrogance, it's just as likely to be the Obama team bragging about it as something Andrew Brietbart (RIP) and real journalists dug up.

Below is everything that Google brought up, excluding fluff like the death of Socks, the First Family prop cat. As Dan Bongino loves to say - remember the names. If one looks familiar, there may be something worthwhile.

First thing Google did after I specificed the search term ""Clinton"", a news search, and 20 January 2009 - 31 March 2009 was demand I fill out a Captcha. If anyone knows an engine with the ability to search news by date like this that isn't pure evil, I'll look there too.

**January:**  Caroline Kennedy announces withdrawal from consideration for nomination to fill Clinton's Senate seat, date unknown, prior to 23rd - suspicious circumstances. Swearing in on 21st as SoS by associate justice on DC court of appeals Kaythryn 'Kay' Oberly, personal friend. Appointment of Gillebrand to replace her in the Senate on 23rd.Announcement of intent to talk with China about 'broad range of issues', 27th. Todd Stern, Clinton associate, named Climate Change Envoy, 27th. Gillibrand fundraising with Clinton connections, 29th - remember the NVIXM connection.Article about Martin Indyk, now Executive Vice President of the Brookings Institution, who worked in the Clinton administration and later served as an ambassador before resigning for Brookings; accused of taking a payout from Qatar in a violation of interests regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, 30th.

**February:** Asia tour announced, statement against a ban on private military contractors, 2nd. Holder's confirmation as AG, 2nd. Clinton CIA Director John Deutch, stripped of clearance for storing classified materials at his house on his personal computer (sound familiar?), pardoned by Bill, appointed to appraise technical capacities of US Intel community, 5th. Warning to North Korea, 10th. Clinton advisors and Citibank executives Lew and Froman appointed to positions in Obama admin, 10th. Praise for Indonesia and its brand of Islamic government, 19th. Downplaying Chinese human rights abuses, negotiating purchase of additional US debt, 21st. Pakistan meeting, 24th. **SOUTH KOREA** - Meeting with then-President Lee, who was involved in a spying scandal, a stock price manipulation scandal, and a massive bribery case, among others - one of the accused fled to the US in 2011 to avoid questioning.

**March:** Middle East tour begins with Egypt, 2nd. $900 million grant to Palestine, criticized for Hamas involvement, 2nd.  Israeli visit, 3rd. News story about parental kidnapping case where the boy's mother took him to Brazil; Clinton makes public statement in favor of his return, 5th. Infamous ""Reset button"" incident, 6th. Appointment of Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, former Clinton advisor, as special advisor on Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, 9th. Joint appearance with M. Obama to 'honor women', including Soros affiliate and alleged benificiary of corruption Ambiga Sreenevasan, Veronika Marchenko, a Russian activist, Norma Cruz, a Guatemalan activist who primarily shows up commenting on a US court decision about a child stolen from her parents and taken to the US, Mutabar Tadjibayeva, an Uzbeki woman who later returned the award because it was also given to the scandal-ridden President of Kyrgyzstan (who took power after a possible color revolution) Roza Otunbayeva, 11th. Announcement that Bill Clinton would not accept $20 *million* owed to him by billionaire Ron Burkle, see also Raffaello Folleri (then boyfriend of Anne Hathaway, according to Gawker), scam artist, and Doug Band, Clinton's initial Epstein connection and media mafia enforcer - Burkle and Clinton invested as much as $100 *million* in Folleri's scam involving Catholic Church properties for an unknown promised payout. Article about Clinton's BlackBerry use, 23rd. Citizens United appeal to SCOTUS approved, 24th. HBO puff piece 'Special Relationship' in development, 25th; Julianne Moore cast for Hillary (lol). Mexico visit, 25th-26th. Joint Statement with Susan Rice announcing US joining UN Human Rights Council, 31st. Nina Fedoroff, alarmist and advisor at State Department, advocates for government intervention to slow population growth, 31st.

Most people know by now that history can tell you a different story.

I noticed it was gone from my sub list. So I did a search for it and couldn't even find it. It's a good thing that my ""active in"" list still showed TD otherwise I wouldn't be able to post this.

So what in the fuck is going on here and what the fuck is a quarantine?",reddit_loves_commies

I started by noticing the patrons. They were picking up their own trash, even the pieces that fell on the floor. Parents were restraining their kids from acting up, making a mess, or taking too many free things like straws. Everyone was kind and deferential to each other and the employees. I noticed that the employees were free of tattoos and piercings and were overwhelmingly polite. Every interaction with a customer was accompanied by a smile, and they wouldn't even let me carry my tray to the trash can. They remained outwardly calm and collected as the drive-thru line wrapped around the block and the line went out the door. The restaurant was clean and inviting, and the bathroom mirror was free of scratch-mark graffiti. I live in Cuckifornia, so the contrast between the establishment and the McDonald's down the street is night and day. Granted, this could be seen as an expression of my own confirmation bias, but it really does seem like warding off hardcore leftists goes a long way to keeping your business free of rude, entitled, and destructive people.",Telepathic_Pepe

Apparently Biden said we need these ""biometric guns"", and it just goes to show how out of touch with reality this dumb fuck is

1. this is real life, not a science fiction novel. There is no technology that would make a gun magically only work with your hand that is reliable enough for you to bet your LIFE on it

2. it's solving a problem that's already solved. Gun safes and trigger locks are already a thing. 

3. it will be hacked. Guns are relatively simple mechanical devices. They have to be easily opened so they can be cleaned or have parts serviced. Anyone with a brain will be able to disable the safety mechanism from a ""biometric safety"", because at the end of the day guns are mechanical devices. Even with an electronic primer and trigger, you could bypass the safety mechanism by making your own ignition circuit

4. What if I have gloves on? do I get to die because the gun won't work?

5. I like the idea and would gladly get a biometric gun... except they are SCIENCE FICTION. These things will never exist, at least not for 100 years or more.

This is not the time to give up. We are united, stronger than ever, and we have a president who has our back.

We are guided by principles and morals, and the country is about to realize that leftists do not have good intentions. 2020 will be the biggest election of our time. The left is angry, and they will be voting by the masses. 

The Clintons will not be exposed if Trump doesn't win. The system is slow, but that slow leak of information will eventually turn into the truth. The truth will hurt 100+ current and former government officials. Bigger fish will fry overseas. 

The Clintons have power beyond our imagination. Tech has more power than they will admit. If Trump can finally give the power back to the American people, the earth will change. 

Changes in social media are about to happen as well, and we need to unite. Us conservatives need to organize a full-scale social media blackout. 1 month, 0 social media, 0 clicks, 0 views, 0 posts. 

We need to crowdsource an Internet Bill of Rights and demand our freedom.

I'm posting a lot of conservative material to Telegram, to a sub that someone started there, coincidentally with the same name as our beloved subreddit here. Overall, instead of making me depressed and hopeless, after returning to the forum, I'm twice as fired up as before.

SO to all of you, don't lose heart, keep up the fight, and if you can, check out Telegram, and help out over there. Let's make them regret they ever tried to mess with (The_Donald)!

I'd been meaning to for some time, but ... inertia and all that. 

If you haven't done this and are considering it, I'd encourage you to do so.  It's quite fast and pretty painless.  It was pretty clean in bringing in my bookmarks, history, etc.  

You will have to re-install any Chrome plugins you need, but think of it as a chance to clean house.  On the plus side, you won't need the overhead of all the ad blockers, etc. that were necessary for Google.  I'll also note that my NordVPN browser extension loaded and functions flawlessly.

The learning curve is almost non-existent if you know Chrome and the performance improvement more than makes up for *any* inconvenience you might imagine.

Did some math to show just how fucking moronic it would be to provide healthcare for illegals.

&#x200B;

I worked on a few assumptions:

1. 11 million illegal immigrants in the USA (lowest estimate I could find)
2. Cost per person would be similar to UK cost per person for the NHS - ¬£2,892 annually.
3. Currency conversion rate as per Goolag.

While I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Trump, I respect the presidency, love this country, and want to see him succeed because of it. I subscribe to this sub because I like to see what both sides of argument are thinking. I‚Äôve learned a lot reading through comments and posts here.  I may not agree with it all but I still like to learn. Reddit quarantining this sub is just silly. Hopefully they see the error in their ways and undo it. Until then, I hope this place thrives. Good luck guys.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that freedom of speech is one of the biggest reasons why this country is great. Regardless of my opinion towards Trump, your ability to express yourself is fundamentally important to the continuation towards a more perfect union. Reddit used to allow freedom of speech to run free, clearly this platform is changing against this thought process though, which is unfortunate.",MiserableMagikarp

Sorry if my post is sort of jumpy everywhere, I was typing this up on my phone during a short break I had at work.

Anyway, I‚Äôm a [former] left-wing Bernie fan from his ‚Äúhome‚Äù state of Vermont. I supported him ever since he first ran for Senate in 2006. At that time, he felt like a fresh breath of air compared to neoliberal policies in DC, especially with his voting record in the house. I loved his promises and everything he said to get elected at that time. 

And yes, I was a giant lefty.

However, that began to change when our state tried getting Medicare for All back in 2012-13. With the plan in place, our STATE taxes would go UP 9-10% (on top of what we already have). I was a poor college student at that time, and considering schools here are expensive, I was massively in debt from student loans. I didn‚Äôt want an extra 9-10% of my income taken away from me when so much of it already went to paying loans. I stated those concerns, and stated there must be a better way to make healthcare affordable for all.

And what happened?

I was called a racist. I was a racist because I didn‚Äôt think about the ‚Äúthousands of poor people of color‚Äù I would be denying healthcare to. I was always like, WHAT?! We‚Äôre the whitest state in the country! Thankfully, Vermont dodged that bullet, barely.

But, despite my rejection, I never changed my views. I always saw conservatives and the ‚Äúclassical liberals‚Äù as fascists for rejecting Black Lives Matter and the LGBT community. 

Then 2015 came. I was absolutely excited when Bernie Sanders announced he was running, especially because no one liked Clinton, Jeb Bush (one of the top Republican front runners then) was less inspiring than Bob Dole (which I didn‚Äôt even know was possible) and Ben Carson always looked like he was asleep. I laughed at the Republican debates and even cheered them on when they were fighting (especially Trump vs Rubio). I thought Bernie had it in the bag.

But then the DNC happened. They gave the nomination to Hillary. And the the most heartbreaking thing happened: Bernie caved. He caved to the monster he claimed to fight against. And so, I became Never Hillary. Instead, I voted for Jill Stein in 2016.

About a month after the election, I moved to Australia and stayed between there and New Zealand for my work, so I never saw what Trump was truly doing; I only saw what the media told me. I was fiercely anti-Trump for the first few months of his presidency, but that June, I realized I was starting to be attacked by the Left for not being Left enough. I still supported a lot of core beliefs, but when I stated stuff like Europe should fight for its culture of freedom and history, I was bashed. 

Then the Russia collusion BS kicked off, and as someone who was born in Russia shortly before the USSR collapsed, I got a ton of Russophobic comments from the so-called tolerants, saying how I was a Trump plant or a Putin puppet and I don‚Äôt belong in America. By this time, I was done with the Left, but I still wasn‚Äôt pro-Trump.

In 2018, I moved back to the USA, and seeing Trump‚Äôs constant wins and the Left‚Äôs constant tantrums in 2018 and 2019, I was starting to question my hatred for Trump. Every day I started to like him more.

And then, the past month happened. Reddit censored you guys. Steven Crowder and other conservatives were censored. And the terrible, disgusting clown fest that was the Democratic Debates happened. I tried giving Bernie another chance, but when he couldn‚Äôt answer his first question given to him, I knew he was a liar and not worthy of the presidency. It literally took me 12 years to realize who he truly was.

Never, EVER in my life did I think I will ever say this, but after watching the Democratic debates the past 2 nights, the most sane and pro-American values candidate is Trump, and even though VT is a hopelessly-blue SJW state, I will vote for him in 2020.

Thanks everyone, for being the actual tolerant people!",melodieva

I see a lot of crowing over the DNC debates, and it‚Äôs well-deserved. But that feeling you have watching them devour each other on the stage... the incredulity you have when they say something *so stupid* you think, ‚ÄúNot even a Democrat would agree with that!‚Äù

The confidence you‚Äôll have in a Trump victory after they announce their rigged winner, because they‚Äôre all dumpster fires...

That‚Äôs exactly what Democrats felt like in 2016. They laughed as Trump rose through the process. They said things like, ‚ÄúEvery time he opens his mouth, he creates more Hillary voters!‚Äù Sound familiar? They were crowing, too... until they were screaming in the streets. 

Democrats learned from 2016, but they learned the wrong lesson. They think that if their process is a big enough circus, conservatives will stay home out of overconfidence like Democrats did. 

*Dont be like them.* Never feel like Trump‚Äôs defeat is so absurd an idea that you don‚Äôt need to vote. Offer to drive others to vote, and actually do it. You may be creating a last-minute opportunity to change their mind. Keep voter registration forms on your desk at work. And of course, keep dispelling lies and dispensing truth. 

There‚Äôs no good reason for Trump to lose in 2020... but that‚Äôs what Democrats thought about Hillary, too. Stay vigilant - even against your own overconfidence. I‚Äôm preaching to myself as much as anybody else.

Let me make this clear(er):  William Cooper made the above video 2 months before 9/11.  He was executed 2 months after 9/11.  9/11 was used to create the PATRIOT act and the FISA court.  No, I don't think 9/11 was staged by the United States Government, I think it was done by the globalists with a little help from the deep state and the swamp.  I know too many good people who work for the United States Government to believe that we did it ourselves.  It is as suspicious, in my mind, as Seth Rich's unfortunate 'failed robbery attempt' that left his wallet, keys, and cellphone on him.  

You know how I know this is all globalist conspiracy?  If AGW was real to the extent they claim instead of a means of creating a global carbon tax, we would have invaded China and India and forced them to stop polluting on the scale that they do.  Could AGW be true?  Perhaps.  I can dig nonlinear effects, but do people act like its real?  Absolutely not.  Just like my theology teacher in college said about the sacrament of communion--if that was really the flesh and blood of our god, I would be pushing myself up the aisle on my face terrified to raise my head.  That is the type of reaction we should be seeing out of scientists, not FUD, if things were as bad as indicated.

I firmly believe that the communists(globalists, global communists) have succeeded in infiltrating our government and all of the crap you are seeing right now is because of the infiltration.  That is why I have voted, and will vote for the GEOTUS in the future.",fffffmagaman

12236,Conservatives vs liberals,21,c6n6ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c6n6ap/conservatives_vs_liberals/,2,2019-06-28 20:41:48,"A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be very liberal, and among other liberal ideals, was very much in favour of higher taxes to support more government programs, in other words redistribution of wealth. 
  
She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch conservative, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harboured an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his. 
  
One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the need for more government programs. 
  
The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school. 
  
Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn't even have time for a boyfriend, and didn't really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying. 
  
Her father listened and then asked, ""How is your friend Audrey doing?"" 
  
She replied, ""Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast. She's always invited to all the parties and lots of times she doesn't even show up for classes because she's too hung over."" 
  
Her wise father asked his daughter, ""Why don't you go to the Dean's office and ask him to deduct 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA."" 
  
The daughter, visibly shocked by her father's suggestion, angrily fired back, ""That's a crazy idea, how would that be fair! I've worked really hard for my grades! I've invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!""
  
The father slowly smiled, winked and said gently, ""Welcome to the conservative side of the fence."" 
  
If you ever wondered what side of the fence you sit on, this is a great test! 
  
If a conservative doesn't like guns, he doesn't buy one.
If a liberal doesn't like guns, he wants all guns outlawed. 
  
If a conservative is a vegetarian, he doesn't eat meat.
If a liberal is a vegetarian, he wants all meat products banned for everyone. 
  
If a conservative is down-and-out, he thinks about how to better his situation.
A liberal wonders, who is going to take care of him. 
  
If a conservative doesn't like a talk show host, he switches channels.
Liberals demand that those they don't like be shut down. 
  
If a conservative is a non-believer, he doesn't go to church.
A liberal non-believer wants any mention of God and Jesus silenced. 

If a conservative decides he needs health care, he goes about shopping for it, or may choose a job that provides it.
A liberal demands that the rest of us pay for his.",whiskeyrum

&#x200B;

Progressives built a set of companies that we now know for certain are connected with one another in multiple ways in order to form opinion and foment their political ideology.

&#x200B;

These companies were integral in the ""Arab Spring"" that started violent revolutions in multiple countries, Egypt Tunisia and Syria being the 'most prominent'.   Wars popped up in many of these areas and from a long term trend, they were almost all now considered to be long term ""bad"" things.  We now know this as the ""Arab Winter"".

&#x200B;

Those same Progressives that preached these wars, now preached for the acceptance of global migration and open borders.   We now have proof that many NGO's and Progressive organizations were doing this for corrupt reasons (see Borderless) many being paid millions.

&#x200B;

They then forced countries to accept these people even going so far as to say illegal immigration somehow pays for itself.

&#x200B;

Now, Progressives are creating laws that says we have to pay for these people, even though these same Progressives were the ones that created their wars and demanded they migrate North.

&#x200B;

My fiance and I are business owners in Southern California and the recent voting patterns have made us terrified at first, but now, just disgusted.  Since we are Libertarians that LOATHE Progressives, we have chosen to move to Texas in July of 2020.  We will both be bringing two more votes to Texas for Trump and no, we are not bringing horrible ideas with us.

&#x200B;

But, what we are bringing with us is a net income of $3/4M annually that we CAN'T WAIT to add to the coffers of the Texas governance.  It has become just nauseatingly clear that we are sick and tired of paying for California Socialist bullshit.

&#x200B;

Anyone else leaving California in the foreseeable future?   I am curious how many tax dollars are walking away from the state, more than what they are actually reporting?",Watchingculturefade

&#x200B;

I have had the honor and pleasure of being with our Donald community for quite some time and love checking the Donald daily to keep track of all our President's accomplishments and real information that mainstream media will never cover, be dishonest about or blatantly 'ignore'. While serving as a Federal employee, I am happier each day knowing Donald J. Trump is my Commander-In-Chief. I look forward to voting for Donald a second time in 2020 and truly believe the moderators of this subreddit have always done a phenomenal job keeping this subreddit the best it can be.

As I have also seen, I write this post for the men and women of our community who like me love our President, First Family, our Flag, Constitution, our nation, our 2nd Amendment and so much more. And yes, the many Patriots who bleed Red, White, and Blue, who love this subreddit, may very well love the Lord or be atheist, are LGBT and understand the importance of being there for one another when the Devil wants us to believe we are completely alone. As we stand with Donald, I stand too with gratefulness and goodwill. The supporters for our president are alive, are real, and very hard-working from diverse backgrounds.

Moreover, I write this posting for the guys and gals who want to make new friendships with fellow MAGA/KAG patriots and are tired of going through the day without at least that one person to speak to, converse with, have laughter with, and/or build our American Dreams together. I write to hope there are those MAGA Patriots who may be seeking a friendship or relationship so the prosperity they may looking for can be found. I write this from my heart so the guys and gals reading this realize they may not have to go to any other website but a home within a home called The Donald to find their ideal match where sharing the realest of information for our future success as a country with President Trump at the helm.  

I wish all readers of my posting the absolute best and as gentleman in my early 30s who sends this shout out, I am here to MAGA with you and replies of kindness, compassion, and thoughtfulness are greatly appreciated. If you want me as your new friend, here I am for YOU. God bless you today and always as this Train has No Breaks.

I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs getting harder for left leaning moderates to logically justify continuing to vote for the left, when what the party is advocating for is far from moderate.  

If this continues, it seems like the Democrat party would only be left with a small radical extremist voter base, and cease to be one of the 2 major parties. While more people would start voting conservative, and libertarian. 

While I hold the belief that traditional Constitutional Conservatism will still be best for our great country, and the American people, I wouldn‚Äôt have any opposition to a reasonable moderate party to work with, and provide different perspectives. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is ever gonna happen, but I thought it was a nice hope for the future.

The term American will have no meaning and no VALUE.

&#x200B;

You the American and the legal immigrant are being gradually ENSLAVED - your tax dollars state local federal will all be funneled toward illegal aliens, directly and indirectly; you will have to pretend you don't see the homeless americans and war veterans as your heart breaks. You will have to keep your head on a swivel as 30-40% of the homeless are mentally ill and wonder to yourself and others where are the Asylums and Mental Institutions to protect both the crazies and the population.

&#x200B;

The Democrats are selling you and your family and friends out for additional SEATS in the HOUSE which controls the power of the PURSE.

&#x200B;

For their ""feelings"" absent of logic and critical thinking.

&#x200B;

They have discarded any emotional sentiment or attachment to the american citizen or the american child. Instead they have committed to the ideal of the foreign national TAKING american citizenship on the BACKS and TAXES of the AMERICAN.

&#x200B;

They celebrate when an illegal alien becomes successful ignoring the opportunity  for an American citizen.

&#x200B;

There are no INFINITE job openings at any workplace, there are no INFINITE seats in a classroom.

* Who pays for them? You the citizen, through taxes both direct and indirect. When they complain about over-crowded schools in Dem states and Dem cities - its generally due to illegal aliens that they refuse to COUNT to determine funding requirements and cost to the American TAX PAYER - that means you that holds a job and shows up to work, and misses time with your friends and family because you got bills to pay

&#x200B;

Democrats keep talking about the stagnant wages over the last 40+ years, yet they refuse to talk   
about the 1965 immigration act, championed by their hero Ted Kennedy, busting open the flood gates of 3rd world uneducated illiterate foreign nationals that came after - as long as companies dont have to compete for talent or labor. WAGES WILL STAY DEPRESSED.

&#x200B;

Forget your future forget your roads forget your infrastructure forget your schools -

&#x200B;

EVERYTHING FOR THE ILLEGAL ALIEN. EVERYTHING FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

&#x200B;

YOURS NO LONGER MATTER.",Deathstalker1776

So, I'm finding it interesting there are suddenly all of these shows out that depict law enforcement and prosecuting authorities either abusing power, framing innocent people or faking forensic science to ensure convictions. While I'm sure some of this is true, I find it fascinating that as the pressure heats up on pedos and international sex trafficking that Netflix all the sudden starts pumping out these types of shows. In my opinion it is a way to get out ahead of arrests and indictments that would implicate some very high level people and portray any sort of judicial effort as a cover-up. They look to cast doubt on the word of investigators, law enforcement and anyone that would levy charges against them. They seek to discredit any evidence that would implicate them by showing how in some other cases, evidence was abused

Some shows that I'm talking about:

**Exhibit A** (My favorite quote so far is 'video is inherently a trick')

**The Confession Tapes**

**The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann** (this one is super obvious that it was a Barry-Podesta production)

**The Thin Blue Line**

**Making of a Murderer**

**Making of a Murderer 2**

The list goes on...

For what it's worth, my last day of Netflix is Sunday, as I've cancelled my subscription due to the giant SJW, white hate, conservative prejudice, etc. type content that has flooded the platform. Seeing this caught my attention, though.

At the very least, it shows me that these people are terrified. **They should be.**",Nerf86

Why?

Because **NOTHING IS FREE**.  Someone somewhere **WORKED** to generate that money, which is being stolen from them through our horrendous tax system and given to those who **choose to do nothing for themselves**.  It is nothing short of a crime to steal the reward of someone‚Äôs efforts to give it to someone else that makes no effort at all.  The saddest part?  These pathetic leeches in society are proud of their lack of effort and their precious imagined victimhood and look for every opportunity to throw their non-effort in the faces of those that **do** work - and then follow it up with insults claiming discrimination or privilege as the reason why the hard working person succeeds and the lazy person fails - it diminishes the accomplishments of the person who strives to better themselves. 

There needs to be a mental revolution in this country that takes us back to the early days of this nation where people put forth tremendous effort to accomplish even small things - like families driving oxen pulling a wagon across unpaved landscape from Virginia to California to make their claim.   How long do you think blue haired screeching millennial would have lasted back then?  They would have been ostracized and left behind. 

We need to make laziness and victimhood an anathema in this nation and come together as one people and understand that there may not be equality of outcome, but there is equality of opportunity - and maybe we do this by having NBA and NFL games end in ties for a whole season to illustrate that both teams earned the right to be in that game, but one team worked harder and deserves the win - and same with life. We are all Americans and have every opportunity to succeed, and sometimes someone else will beat us to the prize - but the thing to remember is **there is always another prize** and that if you work hard enough and don‚Äôt give up you **WILL** succeed.

**ARTICLE 118.** Citizens of the U.S.S.R. have the right to work, that is, are guaranteed the right to employment and payment for their work in accordance with its quantity and quality.

The right to work is ensured by the socialist organization of the national economy, the steady growth of the productive forces of Soviet society, the elimination of the possibility of economic crises, and the abolition of unemployment.

**ARTICLE 119.** Citizens of the U.S.S.R. have the right to rest and leisure.

The right to rest and leisure is ensured by the reduction of the working day to seven hours for the overwhelming majority of the workers, the institution of annual vacations with full pay for workers and employees and the provision of a wide network of sanatoria, rest homes and clubs for the accommodation of the working people.

**ARTICLE 120.** Citizens of the U.S.S.R. have the right to maintenance in old age and also in the case of sickness or loss of capacity to work.

This right is ensured by the extensive development of social insurance of workers and employees at state expense, free medical service for the working people and the provision of a wide network of health resorts for the use of the working people.

**ARTICLE 121.** Citizens of the U.S.S.R. have the right to education.

This right is ensured by universal, compulsory elementary education; by education, including higher education, being free of charge; by the system of state stipends for the overwhelming majority of students in the universities and colleges; by instruction in schools being conducted in the native language, and by the organization in the factories, state farms, machine and tractor stations and collective farms of free vocational, technical and agronomic training for the working people.

**ARTICLE 122.** Women in the U.S.S.R. are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life.

The possibility of exercising these rights is ensured to women by granting them an equal right with men to work, payment for work, rest and leisure, social insurance and education, and by state protection of the interests of mother and child, pre-maternity and maternity leave with full pay, and the provision of a wide network of maternity homes, nurseries and kindergartens.

**ARTICLE 123.** Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life, is an indefeasible law.

Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, conversely, any establishment of direct or indirect privileges for, citizens on account of their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law.

**ARTICLE 124.** In order to ensure to citizens freedom of conscience, the church in the U.S.S.R. is separated from the state, and the school from the church. Freedom of religious worship and freedom of anti-religious propaganda is recognized for all citizens.

**ARTICLE 125.** In conformity with the interests of the working people, and in order to strengthen the socialist system, the citizens of the U.S.S.R. are guaranteed by law :

a) freedom of speech;

b) freedom of the press;

c) freedom of assembly, including the holding of mass meetings;

d) freedom of street processions and demonstrations; These civil rights are ensured by placing at the disposal of the working people and their organizations printing presses, stocks of paper, public buildings, the streets, communications facilities and other material requisites for the exercise of these rights.

**ARTICLE 126.** In conformity with the interests of the working people, and in order to develop the organizational initiative and political activity of the masses of the people, citizens of the U.S.S.R. are ensured the right to unite in public organizations - trade unions, cooperative associations, youth organizations, sport and defence organizations, cultural, technical and scientific societies; and the most active and politically most conscious citizens in the ranks of the working class and other sections of the working people unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), which is the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the socialist system and is the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state.

**ARTICLE 127.** Citizens of the U.S.S.R. are guaranteed inviolability of the person. No person may be placed under arrest except by decision of a court or with the sanction of a procurator.

**ARTICLE 128.** The inviolability of the homes of citizens and privacy of correspondence are protected by law.

**ARTICLE 129.** The U.S.S.R. affords the right of asylum to foreign citizens persecuted for defending the interests of the working people, or for their scientific activities, or for their struggle for national liberation.

**ARTICLE 130.** It is the duty of every citizen of the U.S.S.R. to abide by the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, to observe the laws, to maintain labour discipline, honestly to perform public duties, and to respect the rules of socialist intercourse.

**ARTICLE 131.** It is the duty of every citizen of the U.S.S.R. to safeguard and strengthen public, socialist property as the sacred and inviolable foundation of the Soviet system, as the source of the wealth and might of the country, as the source of the prosperous and cultured life of all the working people.

Persons committing offences against public, socialist property are enemies of the people.

**ARTICLE 132.** Universal military service is law.

Military service in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is an honourable duty of the citizens of the U.S.S.R.

**ARTICLE 133.** To def en d the fatherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the U.S.S.R. Treason to the country - violation of the oath of allegiance, desertion to the enemy, impairing the military power of the state, espionage - is punishable with all the severity of the law as the most heinous of crimes.",ddubs00

> By all means, we should have open conversations and vigorous debate about controversial or offensive topics. But we must also halt speech that bullies and torments. From the perspective of our brain cells, the latter is literally a form of violence.

PT 2017:
> When is speech violence? The answer is never. Speech may be upsetting, but that doesn‚Äôt make it violence. Speech may be ugly or hateful, but that doesn‚Äôt make it violence. Speech may be associated with deleterious physiological effects or even harm, but that still doesn‚Äôt make it violence. Speech may even intimidate or threaten violence. That makes it illegal, but it doesn‚Äôt make it violence. Equating speech with violence not only robs us of our understanding of ourselves as competent and civil human beings capable of defeating bad ideas with better ones, it gives us license to use physical violence in response to speech‚Äì‚Äìor even in advance, as ‚Äúself-defense.‚Äù For psychologists to assert that speech is violence is not merely incorrect, it‚Äôs harmful.

> But it‚Äôs not violence.

TA 2017:
> The conflation of words with violence is not a new or progressive idea invented on college campuses in the last two years. It is an ancient and regressive idea. Americans should all be troubled that it is becoming popular again‚Äîespecially on college campuses, where it least belongs.

NR 2017:
> But that‚Äôs not good news at all. It‚Äôs simply evidence that in the abstract students will claim to be open-minded. They‚Äôll claim to value different views ‚Äî right until the moment they really get offended. For example, 81 percent agree with the statement that ‚Äúwords can be a form of violence.‚Äù A full 58 percent of students believe that colleges should ‚Äúforbid‚Äù speakers who have a ‚Äúhistory of engaging in hate speech.‚Äù

AM 2017:
> Views that invalidate humanity? The concept that speech invalidates the humanity of entire groups of people is preposterous hyperbole. A listener merely has to reject this idea to leave with their ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù intact. Violence is a physical act. Speech is not. If someone punches me, I feel its impact. That is not the same as someone disparaging me to the nth degree with their words. To think that an educator harbors views which effectively conflate words with violence provides us a clue to where students might gain these notions from. (Notions which are then repeated amongst peers until they are eventually parroted out with the zeal of preachers from days gone).",nufosmatic

My new hobby is watching that number grow by the hour and day.  It's encouraging to see Americans of every race, religion, and orientation come together.

I am especially indebted to those brave souls who have subscribed as a matter of principle even though our politics may not agree.  Welcome!  Stay a while and see what we're about.  Sure, you'll see some zany memes and a few discussions that go off on a tangent, but by and large you will find Americans who are just like you:  We want everyone to have the opportunity to prosper & be happy and to do so without oppressive federal government that would have our Founding Fathers spinning in their graves.

Donald J. Trump is a breath of fresh air in a world smothered by the political establishment.  I thank God each and every day for our President and r/The_Donald.",plus_dolor

Please comment constructively and see if we can get this into Congressmen or Senators that can start putting forth this idea in the OFFICIAL public domain.

**THE U.S. INTERNET USER BILL OF RIGHTS**

*INTRODUCTION*

As Users, we do not need regulation, we need *recourse*.
It should be made clear the following:

* High technology companies can not operate outside the principles of human expression and dignity
* High technology companies are shaping both digital and actual realities and there are potentially grave consequences to the Individual and their governance.

For these reasons, it is now required that we establish an Internet User Bill of Rights.

*BASIS FOR RIGHTS*

* Whereas, the US taxpayer has paid for and pays to maintain the underlying architectures that high technology companies (social networks, user-generated content sites, etc) operate...
* Whereas, the US taxpayer has the right to free assembly in public gathering places...
* Whereas, by definition, these **networks** have become digital gathering places...
* Whereas, these networks are harvesting and storing user information and actions and using for profit...
* Whereas, the provider of the digital assembly place use the user information and actions to earn substantial revenue and profit from those gathered...

Therefore, those gathered (i.e., the Internet User) have rights.

If we don't turn it around it will be the end of this country, as we know it, within two decades.

A year ago I needed some heavy landscape done, got a flyer, called and got a great price from a person that was from Guatemala. After he left, I thought ""Too good of a price"". And I realized, I need to live what I preach and not bend values based on convenience or cost. So I texted the guy and asked ""are all of your employees in the country legally"". LOL, he replies in broken english-texting ""All filled up. No more can do work. Busy."" It took me four more calls to others, asking the same question, until I found one that could answer 'yes'. I did report the original guy's company but I don't think anything occurred.

On this next item, I'm going to be vague but hit key points. Yesterday I heard a General Contractor could not do scheduled work on a project because the subs lead foreman was here illegally and got deported. And I thought ""Um, shouldn't we be safe-guarding against this?"" I work in a business that has government regulated specifics for site security, as well as Public Health implications and regulations.

So I reviewed the Request for Proposal and Bid documents of the business I work for and found a number of holes. Me, being cynical, does not believe these holes are an accident. In general, they 'require' contractors to use E-verify and insure their subs do, but that's it. No request for proof at all.

I also looked at the documents contractors and subs must submit with their bid/proposal and, though they each have to answer a lot of questions on a two-page form, and separately sign, with questions like 'safety rating', there is no question such as 'are all your employees legal residents' or 'Did you use E-verify to confirm status?'. Nothing.

I have a bit more weight than others working for the large 'business' I am in, due to the specialization, as I noted above, related to public health and security. So I decide to see how far I can, politely and strategically, push this through the eventual 'Politically Correct' morass it will hit.

The first outreach today was positive, calling Purchasing and asking why these documents are, to paraphrase, so weak. ""Because it's never come up before"". Ok. The procurement specialist was very amenable to updating the forms to correct this huge miss, having each contractor and sub sign-off on 'legal resident' status, but she is one person and this has just started. My next question, strategically placed, will be; ""why don't we require them to submit proof they used E-verify?"".

Last night as we were discussing ""Job"" I could see he was troubled. As I pressed him as to what was wrong he admitted that he was embarrassed to be known as a Christian. He said that his peers (he is 32) make fun of Christian values saying they are outdated. I then went into how the Jews and Christians have been persecuted since the beginning and how hard it is to hold on to your faith even in todays world. How the liberal left has labeled us as bigots, raciest, homophobic and so on when the Bible teaches us to be tolerant with all people regardless of who they are. As the discussion ended I could see he was gaining strength. It wasn't but a few minutes later when he came to me and said he had called a friend and proclaimed that he has found God. He said he had to tell someone, then asked for the cross that his Grandmother had given him long ago. This morning he was wearing it proudly and walking with the confidence of a man who now knows where his life should be. Driving to work this morning I began to understand how the left is demonizing religion and filling young people with these ideas through social media. It seems odd that a man like our President with his past has become our avenging angle and a steadfast champion to all that is good. God works in mysterious ways. I voted for him before and he will get my complete support again! God Bless President Trump and the USA......",wales1958

Why would they do that?! They can't just silence a whole group of people..."" I explained that this is exactly what's been going on for some time. I told her that if the Left ever gets in charge again, they'll probably figure out who we all are and, at the least, doxx us all. She doesn't come on her but I show her a lot of stuff from here. Over the last 3 years I've been able to slowly show her where the real toxicity in our society is, based on the meme culture of this sub. 

This place is special, and when I thought it was gone I started looking for everyone. I went to Voat and saw a bunch of shitty posts about T_D refugees and how we are all a bunch of ""n***erfa**ots""... I almost deleted my Reddit profile. I thought about just going into every sub I could and post ""Where is The_Donald?!"" Until I was banned from every sub here. I realized I don't have a backup for my news source. This place is the most informative place on the internet. I have been ahead of every news story by days, for the last 3 years. I don't use twitter but I checked on there for T_D and found some stuff. 

My point for this post is this, is there any sort of contingency plan where the majority of us will meet to continue the important work this sub is doing? I understand that eventually we will all be so well informed that we will spread out and spread the word on our own, but my god I don't want to see this place taken down. I don't want to lose the support of my fellow pedes. I don't want to lose the invaluable stash of memes here. I don't want to lose the archives of news articles that shine a bright light on the Left's hypocrisy. There is more information in The_Donald search bar, to fight lefties, than there is anywhere else.  Please tell me we have this place backed up somewhere.  If we don't, can some of you beautiful Autists figure out how to make a mirror of this whole entire sub? We need to keep access to the information that has been gathered here. It's unbelievably important. 

Ok, that's my rant. I'm coming off a midnight shift and need to sleep. I hope that you all have a wonderful day. I love how welcoming we have been to all the new subscribers. 

I love you all.",smegmaless

2. Women are not meant to be mothers, men are not needed as fathers. The state is the the true head of the household.
3. Population shouldn't be domestically produced, importing full grown adults is cheaper than growing them from birth.
4. Everything that MSNBC / CNN / your professor says is true. The masters approve of the message.
5. That YOUR parents, grandparents and great grandparents were smarter, worked harder, and were fortunate is UNFAIR to all the people that descended from generations of sloth. Your MUST share what your family created.  
**But ask no questions about their offshore trust funds.**

To disagree with self evident truths means that you're ""eroding our democracy"", you're a heretic, an unbeliever, a fascist, a Nazi.

(""our democracy"" means the democracy that's owned and operated by them and their donors)

we can't just delete this we need a ""reason"" usually some bullshit like this is harmful to those who don't identify in number form. or shows private info (stuff you get on the first page of google). 

what? Do you support a person who a 340million person country chose to lead them? not on this site (insert emotional reason, because emotions now trump(wink) fact)

NOW SERIOUS FACE ON......what happens is these people still believe 2+2=4 but are now angry and more committed to this truth, because censoring this won't change peoples minds. in fact it enforces the idea that the is this global shadow entity in every megacorp pulling strings to fuck you over

they also think if they hide these truths and beliefs that others on their side won't find it. WRONG these people will end up at some point maybe games or a movie the LOVE (Star wars, Ghostbusters ect) then this nanny state know tells you what best for you.

After teeling you what movie was amazing, what movie was bad only to find these are political not objective (AKA funny/good movie/enjoyable) bullshit and soon they will jump down the rabbit hole.

lastly, they underestimate how much people want to find hidden information from them. they wonder why? planting the seeds of doubt. 

P.S.S its like telling your teenage kid not to date this girl because she trouble, now in his mind, he's thinking 
1. that sound fun 
2. i wonder why. 
3. two birds with one stone lets piss mom off

First he tries to remove the largest conservative voice on youtube, and he fails so then he tries to remove the largest pro-trump sub on reddit. Crowder and TD are two of the biggest ways that people online learn about what conservatism really is. I grew up with conservative beliefs, but in highschool i started blindly believing liberal friends, and i started to view myself as more of a centrist than a conservative because i didn‚Äôt want to pick sides. The lies of the media on te internet slowly turned me into someone who hated trump. However, Crowder‚Äôs youtube videos (along with the fact that a close friend i had slowly went farther and farther left) were what redpilled me. 

Crowder draws people in because he gives a level-headed and likable face to conservatism. Before him, the only trump supporters I had ever met were racist rednecks in my school. I found out one of my friends supported trump and i thought he was actually a racist, or maybe a good person but misguided or ignorant. I started watching youtube videos of what trump was really like, and it was NOTHING like the image that the media portrayed. He wasn‚Äôt this bumbling idiot who chokes on words and talks like a kid, he‚Äôs a genius with a big heart and a love for our country. 
People hate trump because they believe the lie that only idiots support him, and by hating him they look smarter. 

The more attention this subreddit gets, or even Crowder gets as maza tries to silence us BOTH, the more attention is given to the two biggest sources of smart, reasonable, compassionate trump supporter on the internet. We need to reach out to people who aren‚Äôt on board with this new face of the democratic party, and let them know who we really are.",animehenat

I don't know much about the KKK to be honest, I know they were founded by the democratic Party, just after slavery was outlawed.I also know one Senator Robert Byrd from the democratic party was in the KKK, and Hillary Clinton herself said he was a "" friend and mentor"".

This fabricated caricature was greedily embraced by feminists and weak men who then internalized these false images as fundamental truth. So essential to their emotional state that they have no rational access to it. **This relationship, oppressor vs. oppressed, frames the whole of their worldview it's the metaphorical color of their sky.**

This is is why the slightest innuendo of aggression by someone on the right is considered cause for DEFCON 1 by Leftists as clear evidence of an imminent Nazi coup, while their own outright statements advocating violence are taken as well considered ... usually to counter this imagined coup.

This caricature has been refined and enhanced over the decades but remains a fundamental feature of virally every Leftists world view (and I'm including those who call themselves ""liberals"" or ""progressives""). They have been trained to see themselves as vigilant sentinels always on watch to expose and prevent ... the impending Nazi coup.

In fact, they are so righteous about this that they have been forging a trail to justify their own Nazi coup ... just to be on the safe (and righteous) side.",Eli_Truax

\[Before y'all ask, no, I didn't watch the debate. I didn't read through any comments before writing this. I did have to google Yang and Williamson, because I didn't have any idea who they were. Bearing that in mind, how close did I get?\]

The Dem Debate too: Dipshit Boogaloo

Your breakdown of the second round of the Democrat Candidate debate.

Our Cast of idiots for this evening and their pertinent points:

Joe Biden: Donald Trump is the worst president ever! Even though by every measurable statistic, when I was the chief knob polisher for Mike Obama, things were worse. Also, my son fought in Iraq. No, not the cokehead who got kicked out of the service. The other one.

Michael Bennet: I'm not the guy who plays for the Patriots, or the guy in the James Patterson books. I'm the other other one.

Pete Buttigieg: I'm Pete Buttigieg, and I'm here to recruit you! I have no new ideas, but I hate Trump, and I'm Gay! Also, did you know South Bend, where I am mayor, is #33 on the list of ""Top 101 cities with the highest number of murders per 100,000 residents, excludes tourist destinations and others with a lot of outsiders visiting based on city industries data (population 50,000+)""?

Kirsten Gillibrand: We also need to expand Social Security to Illegal Immigrants!

Kamala Harris: Who does a girl have to fcuk around here to win the debate? (Please don't say Bernie...)

John Hickenlooper: I know as Governor of Colorado, I said "" I had strong support for the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state of Colorado. I said:

‚ÄúOur first priority remains the safety of our residents. We will work with the federal government and Homeland Security to ensure the national verification processes for refugees are as stringent as possible. We can protect our security and provide a place where the world's most vulnerable can rebuild their lives."" But screw that! Orang man bad! Open Borders and Pot for everyone!

Bernie Sanders: I want a new Beach house! Also, I have a plan to make the Early Bird special at Denny's free for all socialist presidential nominees over age 77!

Eric Swalwell: We'll take your guns and you'll like it! Or we'll drop nukes on you! JK LOL. Trump is a warmonger and violently unhinged. Seriously though, we're going to ban your ARs and AKs and any other gun we think is bad, and if you don't like it, well...

Marianne Williamson: Why does this guy keep sniffing me? (Seriously they let her on stage? Here's her bona fides:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne\_Williamson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Williamson?fbclid=IwAR3eSjosQKhdOwv4s--gNHLs8yXtlkudAkVXVFeXMQ2yBVWW_rDzYauerHo))

Andrew Yang: I'm not going to try to buy votes buy promising free college, free loan repayment, free healthcare or free cars. I'm offering cash. $1000 a month universal basic income for every American over 18. \[the population of the USA over the age of 18 is: 225,746,457. Yang, an Obama ""Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship"" hasn't said where he'll find that $225 Billion--a MONTH, or $2.7 TRILLION a YEAR--that he's giving out.

Yes, Trump would like to send you back. He would also like to make it harder for more like you -- people unwilling or unable to apply for legal entry or asylum -- to enter the country. This is true. \*I\* would like that too.

But you are here now, so think for a moment. You came here, I presume, because of our relative prosperity. Whatever you may think of Trump, you have to admit that he's improved the economy, created jobs, brought back industries, and raised wages. He's done this without causing significant inflation.

So, before you (illegally) pull the lever for one of the Democrat clowns, ask yourself if that prosperity will continue under their administration? Or will they undo all the gains of the last two+ years? Will voting (illegally) undermine the rule of law that is the foundation of our success, and turn this country just a little more into a shithole not much different that the one you left? I think you've thought about. I think you've wondered why some countries succeed while others fail. And I think you know the answer.

Please, for my sake but also your own, do not (illegally) vote for a Democrat this next election! Thank you for your time.",oldchangeling

I called them to ask about the latest sexual assault allegations, with one main question in mind.

""Do you know if Donald Trump ever shopped at this store?""

They told me they couldn't answer that, to protect their customers' safety and privacy. Good on them. The employee I talked to also said they don't put any credence in the allegations, and didn't even know about it until I told them.

So if the store where it's alleged to have happened doesn't know anything about it, it's probably no big deal.

Additionally, I can't think of any reason for the alleged event to have been possible unless Trump shopped at BG on a somewhat regular basis.",ageoftesla

One look at the headlines shows hundreds of example of attention grabbing clickbait.

Take a look at the Trump collusion hoax: every day for 3 years, just about every single media outlet in the USA, UK, Australia and the western world in general pushed this hoax. There were talks of ""bombshells"" since 2016 but we pedes knew this was bullshit from the start.

This COULD be explained by saying ""they just want more ratings/money/exposure"". Until you realise that the most sensational stories of the year, namely the exposure of famous Hollywood actresses at the top of a Satanic child sex slave cult, and Google admitting on record their intent to influence the 2020 election.

Now if it was about ratings, why would this not be front page news in any mainstream outlet? There must be something else motivating them other than profit.

What would motivate a British media company, like BBC or the Guardian, to pass up on the biggest stories of the year? Why would the BBC, which seemingly has no connection to Google, cover up the election interference which they themselves confessed to? Why is every single social media network, media company, and leftist politician, working in perfect unison to push for censorship, if there is no agenda?

Another example is what happened to Tommy Robinson when he exposed BBCs criminal tactics. He had been on social media for years, relatively uncensored. The day he releases a documentary exposing the BBC (which couldn't possibly be deemed offensive in any way), his Facebook and Youtube are targeted and he has charges pressed against him for a totally irrelevant event that happened years ago.

What interest does Youtube, a tech company in Silicon Valley, have in covering up the BBC's crime? Who is ordering the police to carry out these perfectly timed arrests?

It doesn't take a genius to see that all these organisations pushing the same bullshit political agenda are all in it together. Want to know their end game? Just look at what they're all pushing.",-Dode

Thanks to you and your multi-billion dollar coroporate goons looking to censor the right in every way imaginable, you've just given this entire community a massive spike in popularity! Myself included.

I had never even heard of this sub before, never seen it in a comment, never mentioned, never talked about and I had no idea it was even a thing. Until I heard that the sub was censored for no other reason but political descent, with a faux argument that makes Reddit seem justified in their political bias.

Don't be fooled, these multi-billion dollar corporate monoliths are trying to change the 2020 election to get our main man Trump out of office, for no other reason but ""he said mean things about people and i don't like that""

I spent the day off and on looking through this sub and looking at older posts and I don't see anything that resembles calls to violence or threats. Mostly it's just you guys cracking jokes and posting memes. However, I can go to other political subs right now and sort by controversial and see people calling for violence,  overthrow the government, and to personally identify and attack conservative politicians without any kind of repercussions. The double standard here is terrifying and it only shows they are scared of what you have to say. I officially subscribed here today.

Because, by law, a website is a publication. Publications can be sued for libel and slander.

So sites that allow users to post content, in order to be immune to the liabilities generated by users, must remain neutral and not practice editorial activities on the content.

They must be public forums, open town squares.

That‚Äôs the legal requirement for special legal protection under the law.

If you want a website with user content that you control, that you decide what people can share, you can - but that makes all the posts guest publishers, and you assume the LIABILITY for publishing them.

The private company argument is true, EXCEPT for social networks.

That‚Äôs the law, and if a private company wants to be a social network, they do NOT get to do what they want.

They ONLY exception to this rule is the bill of rights. A HIGHER law that limits the government, and others, from infringing on those God given rights.",marble68

I think we need to start accusing them of this.

It's a win win for us.

By quarantining the Dom, Reddit is suggesting there is something wrong with you. Normally when someone makes threats, as a member, they'd get banned. By quarantining the Dom they are saying you threatened someone. Did you?



Some of you may have even though, ""am I in the wrong""? No. Reddit has no business telling you, who hasn't done anything wrong, that there's something wrong with you. That's bullying. They're saying you have a problem. You need fixing. That's bullying . 



You're not the culprit or wrong doer here. You're the victim. And they want to bully you more by shaming you.",qualityproduct
